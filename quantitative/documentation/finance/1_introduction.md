## Financial Markets

- A financial market is a means or mechanisms where buyers and sellers can trade financial assets/securities.
  - Most financial markets are now electronically based, with only a few physical exchanges still in operation.
- Financial securities are legal contracts which give the right to receive (or obligation to pay) a future benefit under a stated set of conditions.
- The role of financial markets is to **efficiently** connect lenders/savers with borrowers/spenders.
  - These markets can facilitate the raising of capital (by companies), the transfer of risk (by investors) and international trade (by governments and corporations).
- There is no single classification system for financial markets, but for ease of understanding they will be divided into four main types:
  - Money markets
  - Capital markets
  - Foreign exchange markets
  - Derivatives markets

### Money Markets

- The **money market** is for the trading of short-term debt instruments, generally with maturities of less than one year.
- Key characteristics:
  - Maturities of one year or less (can be as short as one day)
  - Large transaction volumes (typically exceeding USD 1 million per transaction)
  - Very low default risk
  - High liquidity
- **Wholesale market**: Trades involve large financial institutions.
- **Retail market**: Individual investors can access money markets via bank money market accounts or money market mutual funds.
- Market participants include banks, financial institutions, corporations and governments.
- **Money markets vs. banks**: Banks are more heavily regulated (reserve requirements, government regulations), giving money markets a cost advantage for short-term debt transactions.

#### Treasury Bill Yields

Treasury bills are zero-coupon instruments bought at a discount to face value. The return is calculated using:

**Discount Yield** (annualized):
$$i_{\text{discount}} = \frac{FV - P_0}{FV} \times \frac{360}{n}$$

**Bond Equivalent Yield** (for comparison with other securities):
$$i_{\text{bond equivalent}} = \frac{FV - P_0}{P_0} \times \frac{365}{n}$$

Where $FV$ = face value, $P_0$ = purchase price, $n$ = days until maturity.

**Example**: A 28-day US Treasury bill purchased for \$995.62 with face value \$1,000:

- Discount yield: $\frac{1000 - 995.62}{1000} \times \frac{360}{28} = 5.63\%$
- Bond equivalent yield: $\frac{1000 - 995.62}{995.62} \times \frac{365}{28} = 5.74\%$

### Capital Markets

- The **capital market** is for the trading of longer-term debt instruments (generally with maturities of greater than one year) as well as equity instruments (stocks/shares) which have no maturity date.
- Debt instruments are referred to as *fixed income* securities. Buyers will receive contractual cash flows at periodic intervals - *fixed interest* or *coupon payments* - and, where applicable, repayment of principal at maturity. Examples include:
  - Government/Corporate/Municipal Bonds
  - Government Notes
  - Debentures
  - Mortgages, including mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
  - Asset-backed securities (ABS)
  - Zero-coupon bonds (sold at a discount to face value and do not pay periodic interest)
- Equity instruments represent ownership in a company and will be initially sold in the **primary market** (e.g. via an initial public offering - IPO) before being traded on the **secondary market**. Examples include:
  - Common stock
  - Preferred stock
- The secondary stock market is one of the most closely followed financial markets and is often seen to be an indicator of the overall economic performance of a country.

### Foreign Exchange Markets (Forex/FX)

- The **foreign exchange market** (also known as the *forex* or FX market) is for the trading of currencies.
- Market participants include banks, financial institutions, corporations, governments and retail investors.
- Spot rates are the current exchange rates for immediate delivery of currencies.
- Forward rates are over-the-counter contracts for delivery of currencies at a future date for a pre-agreed exchange rate.
- Futures contracts for currencies are also traded on exchanges, e.g. the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange): [Euro FX](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/fx/g10/euro-fx.html).

### Derivatives Markets

- The **derivatives market** is for the trading of financial instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset.
- Derivatives can be traded over-the-counter (OTC) or on exchanges.
- Examples of traded derivatives include:
  - Forwards
  - Futures
  - Options
  - Swaps
- The underlying asset can be:
  - Cash products (stocks, bonds, some commodities, currencies)
  - Physical products (e.g. agricultural products, metals, energy products)
  - Other derivatives (e.g. options on futures)
- Uses of derivative include:
  - Risk management - reducing exposure (hedging) to adverse price movements in an underlying asset through tailored derivative contracts.
  - Speculation - increasing exposure and taking on risk in the hope of making a profit from favourable price movements in an underlying asset.
    - Derivatives can provide leverage, meaning that a small initial outlay can provide exposure to a much larger position in the underlying asset.

### Movement of Funds

- **Direct finance** occurs when borrowers borrow funds directly from lenders in financial markets by selling them securities. Examples include:
  - A company issuing shares (equity) to investors in exchange for capital.
  - A government issuing bonds (debt) to investors in exchange for capital.
- **Indirect finance** occurs when financial intermediaries (e.g. banks, mutual funds, pension funds) stand between lenders and borrowers by accepting funds from lenders and then lending them to borrowers. Examples include:
  - A bank accepting deposits from savers and then using these deposits to make loans to borrowers.
  - A mutual fund pooling money from investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.

### Primary and Secondary Markets

- The **primary market** is where new securities are issued and sold for the first time. Examples include:
  - Initial public offerings (IPOs) of stocks
  - New bond issues by governments or corporations
- The **secondary market** is where existing securities are traded among investors after they have been issued in the primary market. Examples include:
  - Stock exchanges (e.g. NYSE, NASDAQ)
  - Bond markets (e.g. over-the-counter bond trading)

### Exchange Traded versus Over-the-Counter (OTC)

- **Exchange traded** markets are centralized platforms where standardized securities and derivatives are bought and sold. Examples include:
  - Stock exchanges (e.g. NYSE, NASDAQ)
  - Futures exchanges (e.g. CME, ICE)
- **Over-the-counter (OTC)** markets are decentralized networks where customized securities and derivatives are traded directly between parties. Examples include:
  - OTC derivatives markets (e.g. for forwards, swaps)
  - Bond markets (e.g. corporate bonds traded OTC)

## Financial Institutions

- Financial institutions act as intermediaries in financial markets.
- Their roles include:
  - Reducing transaction costs through economies of scale
  - Decreasing the asymmetry of information between borrowers and lenders
  - Diversifying risk by pooling funds from many investors
- **Investment intermediaries** include:
  - Commercial banks
  - Investment banks
  - Insurance companies
  - Pension funds
  - Mutual funds
  - Hedge funds
  - Brokerage firms
- **Depository institutions** include:
  - Savings and loan associations
  - Credit unions
  - Mutual savings banks
  - Commercial banks
- **Contractual savings institutions** include:
  - Insurance companies
  - Pension funds

## Cash Products

- Examples include:

  - Stocks
  - Bonds
  - Currencies
  - Commodities

## Derivatives

- Assets linked to (or **derived** from) another asset - known as the underlying asset (or just underlying).
- The structure and value of the derivative asset is defined by its relationship to the underlying.
- Examples include
  - Forwards (OTC) and futures (exchange)
    - Set a price that two parties will transact an asset for at a set future date. -
  - Swaps
    - Linked to interest rates, allows a floating interest rate to be switched to a fixed rate.
  - Options
    - Similar to forwards, but gives one party the option (not the obligation) to transact.

## Value

- There are two notions of financial value:
  - **Price** - determined on markets.
  - **Fair value** - corresponds to "correct value".
- The following concepts should be considered:
  - Time value of money
  - Discounted cash flow analysis
  - Arbitrage - relative valuation method and is used for determining the relationship between the value of a derivative and its underlying.

## Risk

- Chance or possibility of suffering financial loss, e.g. losing money on an investment.
- Derivatives can server as risk management tools.

## Modelling Portfolios

- A portfolio is a collection of assets and can be considered as a individual/unit asset.
- The value of the portfolio is the sum of the values of each of the component assets.
  - Each asset will have a natural base valuation unit - i.e. for stocks this would be 1 share, and for FX this would be one unit of the currency (1 EUR or 1 USD).
  - The portfolio values will be expressed in terms of the number of base units for each asset (the *allocation*) multiplied by the respective value of the base units.
- The spot price (cash value) at time $t$ of the base unit for the $i^{th}$asset in the portfolio can be denoted by $S_{i}(t)$.
  - The allocation of the $i^{th}$ asset can be denoted as $\alpha_{i}$.
  - If asset 1 is IBM and there are 100 shares of IBM in a portfolio, then $\alpha_{1}$ is 100.
  - If asset 2 is Japanese Yen (JPY) and there are 100,000 JPY in a portfolio, then $\alpha_{2}$ is 100,000.
  - The value of a portfolio at time $t$ is therefore:
$$V(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i}S_{i}(t)$$
- Any cash held in a portfolio is assumed to be invested at the risk-free rate.
  - Let $r$ be the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate.
  - A lump sum of cash $X$ can be represented in a portfolio's value expression by $Xe^{rt}$, assuming it was brought into the portfolio at time $t=0$.
- Similarly, any debt in the portfolio can be represented as a negative cash allocation.
  - A debt of $X$, taken on at time $t = 0$ at the risk-free interest rate $r$, would be represented by $-Xe^{rt}$.
  - The value of a portfolio containing $n$ assets with values $S_{i}(t)$ for $i = 1 \dots n$ and a debt of value of $Xe^{rt}$ would be:
$$V(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N}S_{i}(t) - Xe^{rt}$$
- The portfolio could have a negative value if $Xe^{rt} > \sum_{i=1}^{N}S_{i}(t)$ at some time $t$.
  - The owner of a portfolio with a negative value would need to pay any potential buyers of the portfolio.

## Foreign Currencies (FX)

- The (spot) price of one unit of foreign currency, priced in the domestic currency, can be denoted as $S(t)$.
- A holding of $\alpha$ units of a foreign currency at time $t = 0$ would be represented in a portfolio's value by the term $\alpha S(0)$.
- Any foreign currency in a portfolio is assumed to be invested at the respective currency's risk-free rate, denoted by $r_{f}$.
  - Similarly, the domestic currency's risk-free rate is denoted by $r_{d}$.
- A holding of $N$ units of domestic currency is represented by $Ne^{r_{d}t}$.
- A holding of $K$ units of foreign currency is represented by $Ke^{r_{f}t}$.
  - This can be represented in the domestic currency by $Ke^{r_{f}t}S(t)$.
- The holding of $K$ units in a foreign currency, $Ke^{r_{f}t}$, can be interpreted as a time dependent allocation of the foreign currency.
  - The interest rate $r_{f}$ represents the continuously compounded return earn by the foreign currency.
  - Returns on the foreign currency can therefore be modelled in a similar way to [dividends](4_equities.md#dividends) on stocks and [convenience yields](5_commodities.md#convenience-yield) on commodities.

## Long versus Short Positions

- Having a **long position** in an asset will cause the portfolio value to *increase* as the asset value increases.
- Having a **short position** in an asset will cause the portfolio value to *decrease* as the asset value increases.
- The simplest way to take a long position in the cash markets is to buy the asset.
  - This can be very expensive as assets will need to be bought outright.
- Taking a short position in the cash markets is not possible on all assets but some do accommodate for this
  - **Stocks** can be shorted on most exchanging using the following mechanism:
    1. Investor A borrows the desired number of shares from investor B who owns the stock.
    2. Investor A then sells the stock on the market for the current market value.
    3. Investor A will then need to compensate investor B for any of the dividends paid by the stock during this time.
    4. Investor A is obligated to give the shares back to investor B at a set point in the future and will need to buy the shares at a future market price.
    5. A lower market price in the future will make a profit for investor A (assuming the drop in the stocks value is greater than the dividend payments). The risk-free rate and transaction related costs (broker fee, capital gains tax, etc.) should also be considered.
  - **Foreign currencies** can be shorted by borrowing money in the desired currency with the aim of paying back the amount with less of the domestic currency.
  - **Bonds** can be shorted using *reverse repurchase agreements* as well as other investment vehicles.
  - **Commodities** can be shorted by using *exchange traded funds* (ETFs).
- Sometimes it is hard to take long and short positions directly in the cash market (e.g. commodities), so investors will use **derivatives** to take positions on assets.
