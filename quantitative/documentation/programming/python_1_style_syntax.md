## Naming Conventions

Identifiers in Python are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, and other objects. These names must follow certain rules and conventions.

- Identifiers **must start** with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (`_`).
- Subsequent characters can be letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
- Python identifiers are **case-sensitive** (e.g., `variable` and `Variable` are different).

```python
my_variable = 10
_variable = 5
myVar123 = "hello"
```

| Identifier                  | Example            | Case Style           | Description                                                                                                   |
|:---------------------------:|:------------------:|:--------------------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Public variable             | `variable`         | snake_case           | A variable that can be accessed from outside the class or module.                                             |
| Protected variable          | `_variable`        | snake_case           | Indicates that a variable is intended for internal use within a class or module (not strictly enforced).      |
| Private variable            | `__variable`       | snake_case           | A variable that is intended to be private to the class. Name mangling occurs (e.g., `__ClassName__variable`). |
| Special (*dunder*) variable | `__name__`         | snake_case           | Variables reserved for built-in functionalities that should not be created by users to avoid naming conflicts.|
| Public method               | `method()`         | snake_case           | A method that can be accessed from outside the class.                                                         |
| Protected method            | `_method()`        | snake_case           | Indicates that a method is intended for internal use within a class or module.                                |
| Private method              | `__method()`       | snake_case           | A method that is intended to be private to the class.                                                         |
| Special (*dunder*) method   | `__init__()`       | snake_case           | Methods reserved for built-in functionalities that should not be created by users to avoid naming conflicts.  |
| Constants                   | `CONSTANT_NAME`    | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | Typically written in all uppercase with words separated by underscores.                                       |
| Class names                 | `ClassName`        | PascalCase           | Follow the CapitalizedWords convention (also known as CamelCase).                                             |
| Module names                | `module_name`      | snake_case           | Should be short and all lowercase; underscores can be used to improve readability.                            |
| Package names               | `packagename`      | lowercase            | Should be all lowercase and can include underscores if necessary.                                             |
| Function names              | `function_name`    | snake_case           | Should be all lowercase with words separated by underscores.                                                  |

## Python Comments

Comments in Python are used to explain code and are ignored by the interpreter during execution. They are **removed at compile time**, meaning they do not affect the performance or behaviour of the program.

Comments start with a hash symbol `#` and extend to the end of the line. Multiple lines can be commented by starting every line with the hash symbol.

```python
# This is a single-line comment

# This is a 
# multi-line comment

x = 42  # Can also comment at the end of a line
```

## Multi-Line Statements in Python

In Python, there are two ways to create multi-line statements: using implicit and explicit line continuation.

### Implicit Line Continuation

Python automatically allows multi-line statements when they are inside certain delimiters such as parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, or curly braces `{}`. This method does not require any special characters to indicate line continuation.

```python
result = (1 + 2 + 3 +
            4 + 5 + 6)

my_list = [1, 2, 3,
            4, 5, 6]

my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2,
            'c': 3, 'd': 4}
```

### Explicit Line Continuation

Python uses the backslash `\` character to explicitly continue a statement onto the next line. This is useful when a statement is long but does not fit into the implicit categories (like when outside of parentheses or brackets).

```python
total = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
        4 + 5 + 6
```

Explicit line continuation with a backslash is generally discouraged if implicit continuation can be used instead, as it leads to cleaner and more readable code.

### Multi-line Strings in Python

Python supports multi-line strings using triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`). These strings preserve line breaks and formatting.

```python
multi_line_string = """This is a multi-line string.
It spans multiple lines,
and preserves line breaks."""
```

Triple quotes preserve newlines, but parentheses and backslashes allow multi-line string concatenation without newlines.

Multi-line strings are **not** comments as they are **not** removed at compile time but can be used for annotating code - such as a [Docstring](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/).

## Conditionals

Conditionals are used to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. In Python, the main conditional statements are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

```python
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # code to execute if another_condition is True
else:
    # code to execute if none of the above conditions are True

x = 10
if x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
    if x < 2:
        print("x is less than 2")
    else:
        print("x is less than 5 and greater or equal to 2")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

### Comparison Operators

- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to

### Logical Operators

- `and` Returns `True` if both statements are true.
- `or` Returns `True` if at least one statement is true.
- `not` Returns `True` if the statement is false.

### Ternary Conditional Operator

Python supports a shorthand way to write conditionals using the ternary operator:

```python
x = 10
result = "Greater than 5" if x > 5 else "Not greater than 5"
print(result)
```

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code and avoiding repetition. In Python, functions can be defined using the `def` keyword.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function
print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

Functions can accept parameters, which are specified in parentheses. They can be required or optional (with default values).

```python
def add(a, b=5):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
print(add(3))     # Output: 8 (3 + 5)
print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7 (3 + 4)
```

Functions can return values using the return statement. If no return statement is provided, the function returns `None`.

```python
Copy code
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

result = square(4)
print(result)  # Output: 16
```

### Built-in Functions

Python has many built-in functions that are readily available for use. Some commonly used built-in functions include:

- `len()` Returns the length of an object (string, list, etc.).

    ```python
    print(len("Hello"))  # Output: 5
    ```

- `max()` Returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.

    ```python
    print(max(3, 7, 2))  # Output: 7
    ```

- `min()` Returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments.

    ```python
    print(min(3, 7, 2))  # Output: 2
    ```

- `sum()` Sums the items of an iterable from left to right.

    ```python
    print(sum([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 10
    ```

- `sorted()` Returns a new sorted list from the items in an iterable.

    ```python
    print(sorted([3, 1, 4, 2]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```

- `type()` Returns the type of an object.

    ```python
    print(type(10))  # Output: <class 'int'>
    ```

For a comprehensive list of built-in functions in Python, visit the official documentation: [Python Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).

### Lambda Functions

A **lambda function** is a small anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. It can take any number of arguments but has only one expression. Lambda functions are useful for short, throwaway functions.

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

The function evaluates the expression and returns the result.

```python
# Lambda to add two numbers
add = lambda x, y: x + y

# Calling the lambda function
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
```

Lambda functions are commonly used with higher-order functions such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))

print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

## Loops

Loops in Python are used to iterate over a block of code multiple times. The two main types of loops are `while` loops and `for` loops.

### `while` Loops

A `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is `True`.

```python
while condition:
    # code to execute

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
# This will output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
```

A `while True` loop is an infinite loop because the condition is always True. It keeps running until a break statement is encountered, which is often used to exit the loop based on some condition.

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter something (or 'q' to quit): ")
    if user_input == 'q':
        break
    print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
# In this example, the loop will continue indefinitely until the user enters 'q'.
```

The `break` statement exits the loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.

```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
    i += 1
# Output:
# 1
# 2
```

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 4
# 5
```

### `for` Loops

A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a `list`, `tuple`, or `string`) or any iterable object. It repeats the block of code once for each item in the sequence.

```python
for variable in iterable:
    # code to execute

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
```

Use `break` to exit a for loop early.

``` python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
# Output:
# 1
# 2
```

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 4
# 5
```

#### Loops with `else`

Both `while` and `for` loops can have an `else` clause. The `else` block executes if the loop finishes normally (i.e., without hitting a break).

```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    print(i)
    if i % 5 == 0:
        break
else:
    print("Loop finished")
# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# Loop finished

for i in range(1, 4):
    print(i)
    if i % 2 == 0:
        break
else:
    print("Loop finished")
# Output:
# 1
# 2

i = 1
while i <= 3:
    print(i)
    i += 1
else:
    print("Loop finished")
# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# Loop finished

i = 1
while i <= 3:
    print(i)
    if i % 2 == 0:
        break
    i += 1
else:
    print("Loop finished")
# Output:
# 1
# 2
```

## Exception Handling

The `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally` blocks in Python provide a powerful way to handle exceptions and ensure that certain code runs regardless of whether an error occurs. They allow for structured error handling and clean up of resources.

1. **`try` block**: Contains code that may potentially raise an exception.
2. **`except` block**: This handles the exception if one occurs in the `try` block.
3. **`else` block** (Optional): Runs if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block.
4. **`finally` block** (Optional): Always runs, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. Typically used for clean-up tasks.

```python
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # Code that runs if the specific exception occurs
else:
    # Code that runs if no exceptions were raised
finally:
    # Code that always runs

try:
    result = 10 / 2  # This will not raise an exception
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
else:
    print(f"Division successful, result is {result}")
finally:
    print("This always runs.")
# Output:
# Division successful, result is 5.0
# This always runs.

try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This raises a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
else:
    print(f"Division successful, result is {result}")
finally:
    print("This always runs.")
# Output:
# Cannot divide by zero.
# This always runs.
```
