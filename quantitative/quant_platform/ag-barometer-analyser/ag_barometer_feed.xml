<p>Producer sentiment fell to its weakest reading since July 2022, as the&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer Index</em>&nbsp;declined 19 points to a reading of 104 in May. This month’s weak sentiment reading was fueled by declines in both of the barometer’s sub-indices. The&nbsp;<em>Index of Future Expectations</em>&nbsp;declined 22 points to 98, while the&nbsp;<em>Index of Current Conditions</em>&nbsp;fell 13 points below a month earlier to 116. Crop price weakness helped trigger the sentiment decline. Eastern Corn Belt fall delivery bids for corn fell over $0.50/bushel (10%) and soybean bids declined over $1.00/bushel (8%) while new crop June/July delivery wheat bids declined nearly $0.50/bushel (8%) in mid-May, all compared to bids available in mid-April when the April survey was conducted. This month’s survey was conducted from May 15-19, 2023.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400">The <em>Farm Financial Performance Index</em> fell from 93 in April to 76 in May, a 17-point decline. Crop price weakness was likely a key factor behind the decline as 38% of this month’s respondents said they expect weaker financial performance for their farm this year compared to just 23% who felt that way in April. Although the top concern among producers in the upcoming year remains higher input costs, the risk of lower crop and/or livestock prices has become top of mind for more producers. This month 26% of respondents chose lower output prices as their top concern compared with just 8% of respondents who made that choice last September. Putting additional pressure on farmers’ profit prospects are expectations for higher interest rates in the upcoming year. Although producer’ interest rate projections have moderated somewhat in the last several months, nearly three-fifths (59%) of producers still said they expect interest rates to rise during the upcoming year and 22% of respondents chose it as a top concern for their farm in the next 12 months. Additionally, 40% of farmers in this month’s poll said they expect this spring’s U.S. bank failures to lead to some changes in farm loan terms in the upcoming year, possibly putting more financial pressure on their operations.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, given the weakness in the other sentiment indices, the&nbsp;<em>Farm Capital Investment Index</em>&nbsp;also declined in May. The investment index fell 6 points compared to a month earlier, pushing it down to 37, its lowest reading since last November. Among the three-fourths (76%) of producers who said it’s a bad time for large investments, two-thirds (67%) said the key reasons are price increases for machinery and new construction and rising interest rates.</p>

<p>In a turnaround from last month, the&nbsp;<em>Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index</em>&nbsp;fell 13 points in May. The May index value of 110 was the weakest short-term index reading since August 2020. In this month’s survey, just 29% of respondents said they expect farmland values to head higher over the next 12 months compared to 54% who felt that way a year earlier. In contrast to their weaker short-term outlook, producers remain more optimistic about the longer-term outlook for farmland values as the&nbsp;<em>Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index</em>&nbsp;rose 3 points in May compared to April. However, this month’s modest rise in the long-term index to 145 still leaves it below a year earlier when the index stood at 149. Among those producers who expect farmland values to rise over the upcoming 5 years, the two most commonly cited reasons for their optimism continue to be expectations for strong non-farm investor demand and inflation, chosen by 66% and 21% of respondents, respectively.</p>

<p>When asked what will be important to them in a new Farm Bill, nearly half (48%) of producers in the May survey said the Crop Insurance Title will be the most important aspect of a new Farm Bill to their farms. Coming in second place as the most important Farm Bill Title was the Commodity Title, chosen by one-fourth (25%) of respondents. In a follow-up question, corn and soybean growers were asked what change, if any, they expect to see to the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) reference prices in a new Farm Bill. Close to half (45%) of corn and soybean growers said they expect Congress to establish higher reference prices for both crops in a new Farm Bill. On the other hand, very few producers think there is a likelihood of Congress reducing reference prices in a new Farm Bill with just 10% and 13% of respondents expecting lower reference prices for soybeans and corn, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>



<p>Farmer sentiment dropped sharply in May as the&nbsp;<em>Ag Economy Barometer Index</em>&nbsp;declined 19 points, the&nbsp;<em>Index of Current Conditions&nbsp;</em>dipped 13 points and the&nbsp;<em>Index of Future Expectations</em>&nbsp;fell 22 points below a month earlier. Weaker crop prices compared to a month earlier combined with ongoing concerns about rising interest rates, high input prices, and even the possibility that recent U.S. bank failures could lead to changes in farm loan terms in the upcoming year all contributed to weak producer sentiment. Producers’ perspective on farmland values in the year ahead weakened as the&nbsp;<em>Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index</em>&nbsp;fell 13 points to its lowest reading in three years. Nearly half of producers feel that the most important aspect of new Farm Bill legislation will be the Crop Insurance Title, while a fourth of producers say the Commodity Title will be the most important part of a new Farm Bill. Almost half of corn and soybean producers expect Congress to raise PLC reference prices for both crops when a new Farm Bill becomes law.</p>

<p>Farmer sentiment improved modestly in April as the&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy</em>&nbsp;<em>Barometer</em>&nbsp;reversed a two-month decline up 6 points to a reading of 123. Both the&nbsp;<em>Index of Current Conditions</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>Index of Future Expectations</em>&nbsp;improved in April with the biggest rise taking place in future expectations. The&nbsp;<em>Current Conditions Index</em>rose 3 points to 129 while the&nbsp;<em>Index of Future Expectations</em>&nbsp;rose 7 points to 120. When asked to look ahead one year, more producers said they expect to be better off financially than now with fewer respondents expecting conditions to worsen compared to both a month earlier and one year earlier. This month’s survey was conducted from April 10-14, 2023.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400">The <em>Farm Financial Performance Index </em>rose 7 points in April to 93, matching the index’s January reading. The prime interest rate charged by U.S. commercial banks increased from 7.75% in January to 8% in late March and a shift in farmers’ expectations regarding future Federal Reserve Board interest rate policy could be one reason the financial performance index improved this month. Compared to earlier in the year, fewer producers expect interest rates to rise over the next year and more producers think rates are likely to hold steady or even decline. This month 34% of respondents said they expect the U.S. prime interest rate to remain unchanged or decline over the next year compared to 25% of producers who felt that way in February. At the same time, two-thirds (66%) of producers expect interest rates to keep rising, compared to 75% of respondents who felt that way in February. The biggest shift was among respondents expecting rates to rise 1 to 2% in the next year which declined to 37% of respondents in April vs. 43% of respondents in February.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Farm Capital Investment Index</em>&nbsp;was virtually unchanged in April at a reading of 43, which was just one point higher than a month earlier. That leaves the index 7 points higher than a year earlier, but still down 32 points compared to two years ago. Among the over 70 percent of respondents who continue to think it’s a bad time for large investments, the top two reasons cited continue to be the increase in prices for machinery and construction and rising interest rates. In a reversal from last month, more respondents chose rising equipment and construction costs (39%) than rising interest rates (33%) as a top reason for this being a poor time for large investments.</p>

<p>For the first time since last fall, the&nbsp;<em>Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index</em>&nbsp;increased compared to a month earlier. The index rose 10 points in April to a reading of 123 while the long-term farmland index held steady at a reading of 142. Even with this month’s rise, the short-term index remains 21 points lower than a year earlier and 36 points lower than two years ago. The shift in the short-term index took place mostly because the percentage of respondents expecting values to decline in the year ahead fell to 14% this month, erasing last month’s 6 percentage point rise in respondents expecting to see a decline in farmland values. At the same time, the percentage of farmers who expect values to rise in the upcoming year rose from 33% to 37% this month. A less pessimistic prime interest rate outlook among producers could help explain the improvement in the short-term outlook for farmland values among producers.</p>

<p>Farm Bill discussions are heating up and this month’s survey included a couple of questions to learn more about producers’ perspectives on Farm Bill legislation. Opinions on the likelihood of a new Farm Bill’s passage before the end of the year are divided. Four out of 10 (40%) of producers think that passage of a new Farm Bill this year is either very likely (12%) or at least somewhat likely (28%). But on the other side of the coin, 29% of producers think that the Bill’s passage is either very unlikely (13%) or somewhat unlikely (16%). The survey queried corn and soybean producers regarding what they consider to be the most important aspect of a new Farm Bill to them. Forty percent of respondents chose crop insurance as the most important Farm Bill title, followed by the commodity programs (31%) and conservation titles (13%). The research and extension and renewable energy funding titles were each chosen by 8% of respondents as a top priority.</p>



<p>Leasing farmland for solar energy production continues to be a hot topic in some parts of the U.S. In this month’s survey, 15% of respondents said that, in the last 6 months, they had actively engaged in discussions with companies about leasing farmland for solar energy production. Following up with just those producers who had been discussing solar leasing with a company revealed an upward shift in the long-term lease rates being offered to lease farmland with nearly half of the respondents indicating that lease rates of $1,000 or more per acre were discussed. In particular, 25% of respondents said that, following the development and construction period, the lease rate they were offered was $1,250 or more per acre while 22% of respondents said the lease rate they were offered ranged from $1,000 up to $1,250 per acre. On the other end of the spectrum, 32% of respondents said they were offered lease rates of less than $500 per acre. Fewer producers reported receiving offers ranging from $500 up to $1,000 per acre than in previous surveys.</p>

<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>



<p>Farmer sentiment improved in April with a more optimistic view of the future being the biggest driver behind the sentiment shift. More producers expect prime interest rates to either hold steady or possibly decline during the next 12 months than felt that way earlier in the year. Producers’ perspective on farmland values shifted somewhat in April with fewer producers expecting values to decline in the upcoming year and more producers looking for values to rise than a month earlier. When asked about the possibility of a new Farm Bill being passed by Congress in 2023, responses were mixed with 40% of producers saying that passage was at least somewhat likely while nearly 30% of respondents think that passage is at least somewhat unlikely.</p>

<p>Farmer sentiment weakened again in March as the&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;fell 8 points to a reading of 117. Both the&nbsp;<em>Index of Current Conditions</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Index of Future Expectations</em>&nbsp;declined 8 points in March leaving the&nbsp;<em>Current Conditions Index</em>&nbsp;at 126 and the&nbsp;<em>Future Expectations Index</em>&nbsp;at 113. Weaker prices for key commodities including wheat, corn, and soybeans from mid-February through mid-March were a key factor behind this month’s weaker sentiment reading. The&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group&nbsp;Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;sentiment index is calculated each month from 400 U.S. agricultural producers’ responses to a telephone survey. This month’s survey was conducted from March 13-17, 2023 which coincided with the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Although the March survey did not include any questions directly related to the bank closures, it did reveal that rising interest rates have become a bigger concern among farmers. Additionally, when responding to the open-ended comment question posed at the end of each survey, multiple respondents voiced concerns about the banking sector’s problems and its potential to hurt the economy which likely also weighed on producer sentiment.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<em>Farm Financial Performance Index</em>&nbsp;reading of 86 was unchanged from February and nearly identical to a one-year earlier. Although the index was unchanged, farmers continue to express more concern about rising interest rates with 25% of respondents choosing that as one of their top concerns for the upcoming year. The percentage of farmers choosing rising rates as a top concern has been increasing steadily since last summer when just 14% of respondents identified it as a top concern. Higher input costs remain the number one concern, chosen by 34% of producers this month, but concern about input costs has been falling since last summer’s peak when it was chosen by 53% of producers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the third month in a row, there was little change in the&nbsp;<em>Farm Capital Investment Index</em>&nbsp;which came in at 42 in March, one point lower than a month earlier but 6 points higher than a year ago. However, among respondents who said it was a bad time for large investments, there was a change in perspective. In previous surveys going back to last July, the increase in prices for farm machinery and new construction was the top choice among respondents as the key reason now is a bad time to make such investments. That changed this month with the increase in prices eclipsed by rising interest rates as the primary reason. High prices for machinery and new construction was chosen by 32% of respondents this month, down from 45% last month, while rising interest rates was chosen by 34% of those who think now is a bad time for investments, up from 27% in February. Rising interest rates was chosen by only 14% of the respondents last summer.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Short and Long-Term Farmland Value</em>&nbsp;<em>Indices</em>&nbsp;moved in opposite directions in March. The short-term index, which asks respondents about their farmland value expectations in the upcoming 12 months, fell 6 points to a reading of 113. On the other hand, the long-term index, which asks respondents about their farmland outlook for the upcoming 5 years, rose 5 points to 142. This month’s short-term index value provided the weakest reading since September 2020 and left the index 32 points lower than a year earlier. One out of five producers in this month’s survey said they expect farmland values to weaken in the next 12 months. Producers’ longer-term outlook for farmland was noticeably more sanguine as the long-term index was just 4 points lower than in March 2022. Although the long-term index continues to provide a more optimistic view of future farmland values than the short-term index, the percentage of producers who think values could weaken in the next five years has been rising. This month 17% of respondents said they expect weaker values in the next 5 years, up from 13% a year ago and 7% two years ago.</p>

<p>This month’s survey included several renewable energy questions focused on the ethanol and renewable diesel sectors. When asked to look ahead 5 years, nearly half (46%) of respondents said they expected the renewable diesel industry to be larger than it is today. This compares to just 25% of respondents who expect the ethanol industry to grow in size over the next 5 years. In a follow-up question, respondents were asked what impact they expect the renewable diesel industry to have on soybean prices over the upcoming 5 years. The most common response chosen by 39% of respondents was a price increase of up to $0.50 per bushel while just over one-fourth (28%) of farmers in the March survey said they expect renewable diesel to boost soybean prices in a range of $0.50 up to $1.00 per bushel. Finally, just over one out of five producers (21%) expect soybean prices to rise by $1.00 or more per bushel as a result of increased demand from the renewable diesel industry.</p>

<p>Farmers’ sentiment weakened again in March as producers expressed less confidence both in the current and future situations on their farms and in U.S. agriculture. Price declines for wheat, corn and soybeans during late February and early March likely contributed to weaker sentiment as did concerns about disruption in the U.S. banking sector. Although producers still cite high input costs as their top concern for their farm operations in the upcoming year, they are becoming more worried about rising interest rates and the impact those higher rates will have on their operations. Farmers are becoming less confident that farmland values will continue to rise in the short run with one out of five producers saying they expect values to weaken in the next 12 months. Producers’ longer-term farmland outlook remains more positive than in the short-run, although the percentage of farmers who expect farmland values to weaken over the next five years is up compared to this time last year and two years ago. Finally, the vast majority (88%) of producers surveyed this month expect growth in the renewable diesel industry to boost soybean prices in the next five years with 21% of respondents expecting a soybean price rise of $1.00 or more per bushel.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer&nbsp;</em>Index dipped 5 points in February to a reading of 125. Farmers’ perspectives regarding both current conditions on their farms and their expectations for the future both weakened slightly as the&nbsp;<em>Index of Current Conditions</em>&nbsp;fell 2 points to 134 and the&nbsp;<em>Index of Future Expectations</em>declined to 121 compared to 127 in January. This month’s survey revealed that producers’ confidence in the future growth of U.S. agricultural exports continues to weaken. In addition, although both land value expectation indices remain in positive territory, more producers think farmland values could weaken in the year ahead than on previous surveys. The&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group&nbsp;</em><em>Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;sentiment index is calculated each month from 400 U.S. agricultural producers’ responses to a telephone survey. This month’s survey was conducted from February 13-17, 2023.</p>



<p>Producers’ expectations for their farms’ financial performance in 2023 compared to 2022 weakened in February. The&nbsp;<em>Farm Financial Performance Index</em>&nbsp;declined 7 points to a reading of 86. Farmers continue to point to concerns about higher input costs, chosen by 38% of February’s survey respondents, as their biggest concern for the year ahead. Notably, in this month’s survey more producers said they are concerned about the risk of lower crop and/or livestock prices than just a few months ago. Eighteen percent of this month’s respondents chose lower output prices as one of the top risks they are facing, up from just 8 percent who cited that as a key risk in September. Concerns about rising interest rates appear to be on an upswing as well. In February, nearly one-fourth of survey respondents (24%) chose rising interest rates as a key concern, up from 22% in the last two months and up from just 14% who cited interest rates as a top concern last summer.</p>

<p>Agricultural exports have been a key source of growth for U.S. agriculture for decades. Monthly&nbsp;<em>Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;surveys since the beginning of 2019 have routinely included a question asking producers about their expectations for agricultural exports in the upcoming 5 years. Producer’s confidence in U.S. agriculture’s exporting prowess has weakened considerably since this question was first included in barometer surveys. Confidence in agricultural exports increasing peaked in 2020 barometer surveys when just over 70% of respondents said they expected exports to increase in the upcoming 5 years. Since then, the percentage of farmers looking for exports to grow over time has drifted lower, dipping to just 33% in the February survey. And in this month’s survey, the percentage of respondents who expect U.S. exports to decline reached 18%, providing the weakest perspective on future exports since barometer data collection began, suggesting that lack of confidence in future agricultural export growth is contributing to the weak sentiment among producers.</p>



<p>The February reading of the&nbsp;<em>Farm Capital Investment Index</em>&nbsp;changed little this month, rising to 43, just one point higher than a month earlier. Weak capital investment readings have been the norm for nearly two years, despite strong farm income. Seventy-two percent of producers in this month’s survey said it is a “bad time” to make large investments in their farming operation while just 15% reported it is a “good time” to make such investments. The disparity between responses to the barometer’s investment question and actual farm equipment sales continues to be focused on costs. In February, 45% of respondents who said it was a “bad time” to make large investments said it was because of the increase in prices for farm machinery and new construction while 27% of respondents chose “rising interest rates” as a primary reason for it being a poor time for making large investments. The percentage of respondents focused on rising interest rates as a key reason has doubled since last July when this question was first included in a barometer survey.</p>

<p>Both the short and long-term farmland value indices weakened in February. The&nbsp;<em>Short-Term Farmland Value Index</em>declined one point to 119 while the&nbsp;<em>Long-Term Farmland Value Index</em>&nbsp;dropped 5 points to 137. Although both indices remain above 100, indicating a positive outlook on farmland values, the percentage of producers who said they expect values to decline over the next 5 years reached 19% this month, the highest percentage since this question was first routinely included in barometer surveys in 2019. Still, over half (56%) of respondents expect values 5 years from now to be higher than today. This month just 33% of respondents said they expect values to rise in the next 12 months while 14% said they expect values to weaken.</p>

<p>Each year in February, the barometer survey includes a question focused on farm growth, asking respondents what annual growth rate they expect for their farm over the next 5 years. This year 49% of the survey respondents said their farm either had “No plans to grow” (33%) or “Plan to exit or retire” (16%). There was very little change in the percentage of farms choosing a growth rate of “Less than 5% annually”, totaling 19% of respondents this year vs. 18% a year ago. However, the percentage of farms in the under 5% growth category has risen since 2020 when just 12% of respondents were in this group. The percentage of farms in the rapid growth category of 5 to 10% annual growth rose this year to 22%, reversing a longer-term decline for this group. For comparison purposes, in 2016 29% of farms in the barometer survey said they expected growth of 5 to 10% annually. The percentage of farms in this group has trended down since 2016, bottoming out in 2022 at 19%. It remains to be seen if this is a trend reversal or a one-year aberration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Leasing of farmland for solar energy production is a hot topic in many parts of the U.S. Barometer surveys have periodically included questions about solar leasing dating back to late spring 2021. Both the January and February 2023 surveys asked respondents if they have engaged in discussions with companies about leasing farmland for solar energy production. Across those two most recent surveys, just over 10% of respondents said they had discussed a solar lease with a company. Each time we’ve surveyed farmers about solar leases, the survey also included a question about the annual lease payment offered by solar companies. This month’s survey suggests companies have started to increase lease rates they are willing to pay. In February, nearly half (48%) of respondents who discussed solar leasing with a company reported that they were offered a lease rate above $1,000 per acre. In prior surveys the percentage of respondents who reported a lease rate this high ranged from a low of 27% to a high of 35%. At the same time, the percentage of farmers reporting lease rates of $500 up to $1,000 per acre fell substantially in February compared to prior surveys.</p>

<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>



<p>Farmer sentiment weakened in February as producers continue to be concerned about high input costs and, increasingly, the risk of declining output prices and rising interest rates. Longer term, the percentage of producers who expect to see U.S. agricultural exports rise has been declining for some time and reached a new low this month. Although both the long-term and short-term farmland value indices remain in positive territory, the percentage of producers who expect farmland values to fall in the upcoming year has been rising, reaching a life-of-survey peak in February. In the two most recent barometer surveys approximately 10% of farms reported having solar leasing discussions with companies and, in February, nearly half of them said they were offered an annual lease rate of over $1,000 per acre.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-right"><em><a href="https://ag.purdue.edu/commercialag/ageconomybarometer/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/January-2023-Ag-Economy-Barometer-1.pdf">Download report (pdf)</a></em></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer&nbsp;</em>Index rose again in January, to a reading of 130, 4 points above its 2022 year-end index value. The January survey results also pushed the index 34% above its 2022 low point which occurred last June. The barometer’s modest rise in January was primarily attributable to better expectations for the future as the&nbsp;<em>Future Expectations Index</em>&nbsp;rose 5 points to 127 while the&nbsp;<em>Index of Current Conditions,</em>&nbsp;with a value of 136, changed little compared to December. The&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group&nbsp;Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;sentiment index is calculated each month from 400 U.S. agricultural producers’ responses to a telephone survey. This month’s survey was conducted from January 16-20, 2023.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<em>Financial Performance Index</em>&nbsp;dropped to 93 this month, down from 109 in December, but that primarily reflects producers’ being asked to look ahead to 2023 and compare it to 2022 rather than comparing 2022 to 2021, which is what the question in December did.&nbsp;&nbsp;To help gauge the change in producers’ expectations for 2023 compared to 2022, the December survey included a question asking producers to look ahead to 2023. Responses to that question were similar to those received this month helping confirm that, compared to a very strong income in 2022, producers expect to see margins tighten in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twenty-two percent of the respondents in this month’s survey said they expect to have a larger farm operating loan than in 2022, which was down somewhat from last January when 27 percent of respondents expected to have a larger operating loan. Among respondents who expect to have a larger operating loan this year, only 5% said it was because they are carrying over unpaid operating debt while 80% said it was attributable to input cost increases. The percentage of respondents who attribute their need for a larger loan to unpaid operating debt has fallen sharply since we first posed this question in January 2020. In 2020, just over one-third of producers who anticipated needing a larger operating loan said it was because of unpaid operating debt. That percentage fell to 20% in 2021 and 13% in 2022 before declining again to just 5% in 2023. The sharp decline in the percentage of producers expecting to carry over unpaid operating debt provides support to the idea that the vast majority of producers are entering 2023 in a strong financial position.</p>

<p>The January reading of the&nbsp;<em>Farm Capital Investment Index</em>&nbsp;climbed 2 points to 42. January marked the second month in a row the index rose, the first time that’s occurred since the fall of 2020. January’s modest rise pushed the index up 35% compared to its November 2022 low, although the index remained 7% lower than a year earlier. Just over 7 out of 10 survey respondents in January said they think now is a bad time to make large investments in their farm operation. Among those respondents who feel that way, 39% said it was because of high prices for machinery and new construction, down from 47% who pinpointed cost as the primary reason for holding off on investments back in November. Compared to November more respondents in January pointed to rising interest rates (25% vs. 19%) and uncertainty about farm profitability (12% vs. 10%) as their primary reason for thinking now is a bad time to make large investments.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Short-Term Farmland Value Index</em>&nbsp;declined again in January, falling to 120, 4 points below its year-end reading. Compared to a year earlier, this month’s short-term index was down 22 points, a decline of 15%. Weakness in the index this month was primarily attributable to respondents’ opinion shifting from expecting farmland values to rise in the upcoming year to expecting values to hold steady. The&nbsp;<em>Long-Term Farmland Values Index</em>&nbsp;rose slightly to 142 from 140 in December. Over the last year, the long-term index has declined just 2% as producers continue to retain a more optimistic long-term than short-term view of farmland values. Among producers who expect to see farmland values rise over the next 5 years, the top 2 reasons for their optimism continue to be non-farm investor demand and inflation, chosen by 63% and 23% of respondents, respectively.</p>

<p>This month’s survey included questions about leasing farmland for carbon sequestration. Compared to responses received when we first included questions about carbon sequestration in the first quarter of 2021, it appears that interest in carbon contracts has been relatively consistent. During the first quarter of 2021, approximately 7% of survey respondents said they had engaged in discussions with companies about being paid to capture carbon on their farms. When we repeated the question about carbon payments in August 2022 and again in January 2023, approximately 9% of respondents said they had discussed a carbon contract with a company. Despite producers’ ongoing interest in carbon contracts, few have signed a contract. Just 1% of survey respondents in January reported that they had signed a carbon contract.</p>



<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>



<p>The improvement in farmer sentiment observed in December carried over into the new year as the&nbsp;<em>Ag Economy Barometer Index</em>&nbsp;rose 4 points above the December reading in January. An improvement in future expectations was the driver behind the modest rise in sentiment, as the&nbsp;<em>Future Expectations Index</em>&nbsp;rose 5 points in January. Although producers were a bit more optimistic about the future this month, they again reported expectations for tighter margins in 2023 than in 2022. Just over one out of five producers expect to have a larger operating loan in 2023 than in 2022, with higher operating expenses being the most commonly cited reason. But producers appear to be entering 2023 in a strong financial position despite the rise in production costs. The percentage of producers who reported the reason for a larger operating loan in the upcoming year declined for the third year in a row, dipping to just 5% in 2023. U.S. farmers continue to express interest in and engage in discussions with companies offering carbon contracts, although to date just 1% of producers report having signed a carbon contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-right"><em><a href="https://ag.purdue.edu/commercialag/ageconomybarometer/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/December-2022-Ag-Economy-Barometer.pdf">Download report (pdf</a><a href="https://ag.purdue.edu/commercialag/ageconomybarometer/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/November-2022-Ag-Economy-Barometer.pdf">)</a></em></p>



<p>Producer sentiment improved sharply in December as the&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer Index</em>&nbsp;reading of 126 was 24 points higher than a month earlier. Although U.S. farmers were more positive regarding both the current situation as well as their expectations for the future, by far the biggest improvement was in their assessment of current conditions. The&nbsp;<em>Current Conditions Index</em>&nbsp;reached 135, 37 points higher than in November while the&nbsp;<em>Future Expectations Index</em>&nbsp;hit 122, 18 points above a month earlier. The&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group&nbsp;Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;sentiment index is calculated each month from 400 U.S. agricultural producers’ responses to a telephone survey. This month’s survey was conducted from December 5-9, 2022.</p>



<p>The improvement in current sentiment was motivated by producers’ stronger perception of current financial conditions on their farms as the&nbsp;<em>Farm Financial Performance Index</em>&nbsp;climbed 18 points above the prior month’s reading to reach 109 which was the only time in 2022 that the index was above 100. The turnaround in the&nbsp;<em>Financial Performance Index</em>&nbsp;this month was driven by a sharp increase in the percentage of producers who expect better performance than last year which jumped from 23 to 35% of respondents. Meanwhile, the percentage expecting weaker performance fell from 32 to 26%. The change in perception among producers regarding their farms’ financial situation could be attributable to producers taking time to estimate their farms’ 2022 income following the completion of the fall harvest. This month’s improved assessment of farm financial conditions is consistent with USDA’s forecast for strong net farm income in 2022.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Farm Capital Investment Index</em>&nbsp;climbed 9 points this month to 40 which was the highest reading for the index since February. Despite the improvement the index was still 9 points lower than a year earlier. Among the nearly three-quarters of all respondents who said it was a bad time for large investments, the most commonly cited reason, chosen by 41% of respondents, continues to be high prices for farm machinery and new construction. However, rising interest rates are becoming a bigger concern among producers. This month 28% of respondents who said it’s a bad time to make large investments cited rising interest rates as a reason, which is double the percentage of respondents who chose rising interest rates back in July.</p>

<p>Despite the improvement in farmers’ perception of their financial situation, both the short-term and long-term farmland value indices continued to drift lower in December. The short-term index fell 5 points to 124 while the long-term index declined from 144 to 140. Although both farmland value indices remain in positive territory, when examined over the course of the last year it’s clear that sentiment among producers about farmland values has shifted. For example, compared to a year ago the percentage of respondents who expect to see farmland values decline in the upcoming year increased from just 6% to 15% while the percentage expecting to see values rise declined from 59% to 39%. Among producers who expect farmland values to rise over the next 5 years, just over three-fourths of them said that a combination of non-farm investor demand and inflation are the main reasons they expect to see values rise.</p>

<p>Looking to the year ahead, the December survey asked producers to compare their expectations for their farm’s financial performance in 2023 to that of 2022. Producers indicated they expect financial performance in 2023 to fall below this year. Responses to the question about 2023 provide a financial performance index value that is 18 points lower than for responses from the question asking producers to compare 2022 to 2021. Rising costs and narrowing margins are key reasons for the lower index in 2023. Concerns about costs continue to be top of mind for producers’ when asked to look ahead to the upcoming year. For example, nearly half (47%) of the crop producers in this month’s survey said they expect farmland cash rental rates in 2023 to rise above the prior year. And in a related question, 45% of producers cited higher input costs as their top concern in 2023 followed by rising interest rates (22% of respondents) and lower crop or livestock prices (13% of respondents).&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>



<p>Farmer sentiment improved markedly at year-end as the&nbsp;<em>Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;index rose 24 points compared to November. December’s sentiment reading was the most positive of 2022, just barely eclipsing the February index value. The biggest shift from November to December was producers’ improved perception of current conditions, although expectations for the future also improved. A recognition among producers that farm financial performance in 2022 was stronger than expressed in previous surveys was likely the primary reason for the improvement in the&nbsp;<em>Current Conditions Index</em>. Although the&nbsp;<em>Future Expectations Index</em>&nbsp;also rose this month, farmers expect their farms’ financial performance in 2023 to be weaker than in 2022, citing higher costs as a key reason.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farmer sentiment was unchanged in November as the&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer Index&nbsp;</em>came in at a reading of 102, the same as in October. There was however a slight shift in underlying sentiment as the&nbsp;<em>Index of Current Conditions&nbsp;</em>declined 3 points this month to a reading of 98 while the&nbsp;<em>Index of Future Expectations&nbsp;</em>rose 2 points to 104. This month’s survey was conducted the week following the November U.S. elections but, unlike the period immediately following the two most recent presidential elections, there did not appear to be a noticeable sentiment swing attributable to the election outcomes. The&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer&nbsp;</em>sentiment index is calculated each month from 400 U.S. agricultural producers’ responses to a telephone survey. This month’s survey was conducted from November 14-18, 2022.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Farm Financial Performance Index&nbsp;</em>improved modestly this month to 91, up 5 points from last month, but that still left the index 14% below its year ago level of 106. The relatively weak index reading is attributable to the fact that more producers continue to say they expect their farms’ financial performance to be worse this year than last year compared to those who expect better performance. However, nearly half (45%) of producers say they expect financial performance this year to match 2021’s. Combined, this means that over two-thirds (68%) of producers say they expect financial performance in 2022 to match or exceed that of the prior year, providing a more positive perspective than that provided by the index examined in isolation. Concerns about high input costs continue to weigh on producers’ minds with 42% of respondents in this month’s survey citing that as their top concern in the year ahead. Just over one-fifth (21%) of respondents chose rising interest rates as a top concern while input availability and declining commodity prices were chosen as a top concern by 14% of respondents.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Farm Capital Investment Index&nbsp;</em>dropped back to its record low of 31 in November. This month’s decline of 7 points pushes the reading back to its September level, erasing the modest rise in the index that took place in October. It’s become increasingly clear that the index is capturing the perception among producers that this is not a good time to make large investments because prices for farm machinery and construction are high. This month just 10% of respondents said now is a “good time” to make large investments while 79% said it was a “bad time”. Among the nearly 80% of respondents who said now is a “bad time” to make large investments, almost half (47%) chose “rising prices of farm machinery and new construction” as the primary reason for their perspective.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Long-Term Farmland Value Index&nbsp;</em>held steady this month with a reading of 144 while the short-term index declined slightly to a reading of 129, 4 points lower than last month. Although farmland auction results in the Corn Belt continue to set new record highs, both farmland value indices are well off the highs established in fall 2021. Survey results indicate farmers are less bullish about future farmland values than a year ago. Looking behind the indices to the raw responses to the survey questions reveals a noticeable uptick in the percentage of respondents who think farmland values could weaken. When asked to look ahead one year, 12% of respondents this month said they expect values to decline compared to just 4% who felt that way a year ago. Among producers who expect farmland values to rise over the next 5 years, over half (52%) chose non-farm investor demand as the primary reason for their optimism.</p>

<p>Given the sharp rise in energy prices that’s taken place this year, this month’s survey asked producers how they’ve responded to the increase in their costs. Just over a fourth (27%) of this month’s respondents indicated they’ve made changes in their operation because of rising energy prices. When queried further regarding the changes they’ve implemented, responses were quite varied. The top response chosen by one-third of those making changes was reduced tillage followed by reduced nitrogen rates and/or changed application timing which was chosen by 24% of respondents. Increased use of no-till was chosen by 11% of respondents while 8% said they reduced crop drying. Respondents who chose the “other” category when responding were asked to specify what change they made. Farmers listed a variety of specific changes with two of the more common ones being the use of solar panels and contracting fuel needs.</p>

<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>



<p>Farmer sentiment was unchanged in November compared to October, with the&nbsp;<em>Ag Economy Barometer Index&nbsp;</em>remaining at 102. The&nbsp;<em>Farm Financial Performance Index&nbsp;</em>rose 5 points this month and just over two-thirds of respondents said they expect their farms’ financial performance in 2022 to equal or exceed that of the prior year. A large majority of farmers think high prices for farm machinery and new construction make now a bad time to make large investments in their farming operations. Although most producers expect farmland values to rise over both the next 12 months and the next five years, the percentage of producers who think values will decline in the year ahead has been rising. Looking ahead to 2023, producers continue to cite high input costs as their number one concern. Finally, just over one- fourth of respondents said they’ve made changes in their farm operation in response to a sharp rise in energy costs.</p>

<p>Farmer sentiment weakened again in October as the&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;fell to a reading of 102, down 10 points compared to a month earlier. Both of the barometer’s sub-indices, the&nbsp;<em>Index of Current Conditions</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>Index of Future Expectations,</em>&nbsp;declined this month. The&nbsp;<em>Current Conditions Index</em>&nbsp;dipped 8 points to a reading of 101 while the&nbsp;<em>Future Expectations Index&nbsp;</em>dropped 11 points to a reading of 102. When the barometer survey was launched in October 2015 estimates from the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016 served as the barometer’s base period and the average&nbsp;<em>Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;index value over those two quarters was 100. This month’s survey results suggest that farmer sentiment is on par with that of late 2015 and early 2016. The comparison is interesting because this year’s weakness in farmer sentiment is taking place despite very strong net farm income compared to the earlier period. USDA estimates indicate that U.S. inflation adjusted net farm income averaged across 2021 and 2022 is more than 40% above the 2015-2016 average. The&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group&nbsp;Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;sentiment index is calculated each month from 400 U.S. agricultural producers’ responses to a telephone survey. This month’s survey was conducted from October 10-14, 2022.</p>

<p>Concerns about their farm’s financial performance was one of the drivers of weakening sentiment among producers. The&nbsp;<em>Farm Financial Performance Index</em>&nbsp;fell 13 points this month to 86. This month’s weaker financial performance reading is a distillation of producers’ concerns about high input costs combined with weaker commodity prices. Challenging shipping conditions throughout the Mississippi river valley have hampered exports recently and the corresponding widespread weakening of corn and soybean basis levels might be contributing to heightened concerns about financial performance. Looking ahead to next year, over 40% of producers in the October survey view high input costs as their top concern followed by rising interest rates which was chosen by 21% of respondents. This month the percentage of producers choosing lower output prices as a top concern rose to 13%, matching the percentage of producers who chose input availability as a major concern.</p>

<p>After dipping to a new record low last month, the&nbsp;<em>Farm Capital Investment Index</em>&nbsp;improved this month to a reading of 38. The rise in the investment index was driven by a reduction in the percentage of producers who said now is a bad time to make large investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the index’s modest rise in October, the investment index remains mired near its all-time low. Once again, a follow-up question posed to producers who view this as a bad time for large investments revealed that increasing prices for farm machinery and new construction (40% of respondents) was the primary reason for the negative outlook. However, that was down from 49% who chose high prices two months ago as their top concern with rising interest rates (20%) and uncertainty about farm profitability (17%) coming in second and third, respectively.</p>

<p>Both the short and long-term farmland value indices rose this month. The&nbsp;<em>Short-Term Farmland Value Expectation Index</em>&nbsp;rose 10 points to a reading of 133 while the&nbsp;<em>Long-Term Farmland Value</em>&nbsp;<em>Index</em>&nbsp;rose 5 points to 144. Strength in both indices comes on the heels of reports from farmland auctions around the Corn Belt that land values are setting new record highs again this fall. The short-term index rose in October primarily because more respondents said they expect values to rise over the next year whereas the shift in the long-term index was primarily the result of fewer producers saying they expect values to decline over the next year. A shift in perspective regarding the drivers of farmland values occurred this month among respondents who said they expect values to rise over the next five years. Notably, fewer farmers chose non-farm investor demand as the primary reason they expect values to rise while more farmers chose inflation as a reason that they expect to see values rise. Even with this month’s rise both indices remain weaker than a year earlier. The short-term index this month was 15% lower than in October 2021 while the long-term index was 11% below a year ago.</p>

<p>Farm policy discussions are underway around the nation as Congress prepares for debate on a new Farm Bill in 2023. As a result, several farm policy related questions were included in this month’s barometer survey and posed to crop producers. Crop producers were asked which two policies or programs would be most important to their farm in the upcoming five years. The top choice was interest rate policy (36% of respondents) followed by crop insurance program (27% of respondents). Environmental policy was chosen by 16% of crop producers with conservation policy (11%) and climate policy (10%) in a near dead heat. When asked how effective the current ARC-County and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) programs are at providing a financial safety net, 72% of respondents rated the two programs as either “somewhat” (61%) or “very effective” (11%). When the same question was posed relative to crop insurance, 84% of respondents rated it as either “somewhat” (56%) or “very effective” (28%).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>



<p>Farmer sentiment declined again in October with the <em>Ag Economy Barometer</em> falling 10 points to a reading of 102. Producers were less optimistic about both current conditions on their farms as well their expectations for the future. This month’s weakness in farmer sentiment pushes the index back near levels observed in late 2015 and early 2016 when farm income was sharply lower than it has been the last two years. Producers are concerned about their farms’ financial performance, highlighted by issues surrounding both the cost and availability of key inputs. Although fewer producers this month said they view now as a bad time to make large investments, which helped push the&nbsp;<em>Farm Capital Investment Index</em>&nbsp;higher, the index remains at a weak level with the cost of new machinery a major concern. Despite the weakness exhibited in farmer sentiment, both the short and long-term farmland value indices rose this month. Among farmers who expect farmland values to rise, more of them cited inflation as a reason for values to rise than in prior months. Finally, producers are concerned about the impact U.S. interest rate policy will have on their farms and the ag economy with over one-third of crop producers choosing it as the most important policy issue for their farming operation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;index drifted lower to a reading of 112 in September which was 5 points lower than a month earlier. The decline in farmer sentiment was primarily the result of producers’ weaker perception of current conditions as the&nbsp;<em>Current Conditions Index</em>&nbsp;declined to 109, 9 points lower than in August. The&nbsp;<em>Index of Future Expectations</em>&nbsp;also weakened slightly, declining 3 points from a month earlier to a reading of 113. Compared to a year earlier, the barometer this month was 10% lower while producers’ assessment of current conditions was down 22%. These results stand in contrast with future expectations in September which was only 2% weaker than a year ago. The&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group&nbsp;Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;sentiment index is calculated each month from 400 U.S. agricultural producers’ responses to a telephone survey. This month’s survey was conducted from September 19-23, 2022, a week or more following USDA’s September&nbsp;<em>Crop Production</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates&nbsp;</em>(WASDE).</p>

<p>Higher input costs are still the number one concern among survey respondents with the shift in U.S. monetary policy rising to the forefront as an issue among U.S. producers. This month 44% of respondents chose “higher input costs” as their number one concern, down from 53% last month. Second on the list of producers’ concerns for the upcoming year was “rising interest rates”, chosen by 23% of respondents, up from 14% in August. Third on the list of concerns was “availability of inputs” chosen by 14% of producers in the survey. The percentage of producers with concerns about input availability has been relatively stable over the last 3 months, ranging from a low of 12% to a high of 15% suggesting this issue is not going away. Interestingly, the percentage of producers choosing “lower crop and/or livestock prices” as one of their biggest concerns declined over the summer. In July 19% of respondents chose it as one of their biggest concerns while just 8% of producers chose it in this month’s survey.</p>



<p>This month’s&nbsp;<em>Farm Financial Performance Index</em>&nbsp;was unchanged from a month earlier at 99 but was still 10% lower than a year earlier. Compared to earlier this year, producers clearly feel better about their farm’s financial performance. Back in May, 38% of respondents said they expected their farm’s financial performance in 2022 to be worse than in 2021. This month that percentage declined to 29% while the percentage expecting better performance rose from 19% in May to 28% this month. Uncertainty surrounding input costs and availability was partly responsible for the negative perspective held last spring by many producers. As the year unfolded, however, producers’ worst fears regarding input cost rises and poor input availability did not materialize providing much more certainty to their farm’s financial outlook and contributing to their improved perspective on farm financial performance.&nbsp;</p>



<div id="attachment_12706" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12706" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12706 size-full" src="https://ag.purdue.edu/commercialag/ageconomybarometer/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Figure3.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="696" srcset="https://ag.purdue.edu/commercialag/ageconomybarometer/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Figure3.jpg 960w, https://ag.purdue.edu/commercialag/ageconomybarometer/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Figure3-300x218.jpg 300w, https://ag.purdue.edu/commercialag/ageconomybarometer/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Figure3-768x557.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p id="caption-attachment-12706" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Farm Financial Performance Index, April 2018-September 2022.</p></div>



<p>The&nbsp;<em>Farm Capital Investment Index</em>&nbsp;declined to a record low of 31 in September as producers continue to indicate that they do not view this as a “good time” to make large investments in their farming operations. Despite that negative perspective, the percentage of producers who plan to reduce their farm machinery purchases declined again this month, down 2 points compared to responses in August. Since peaking in March at 62 percent, the share of producers who plan to reduce their machinery purchases compared to a year earlier has been declining, dipping to 47% this month. Producers’ plans for farm building purchases tell a similar story, declining from a high of 68% who planned to reduce their building and grain bin purchases back in March to 56% who felt that way in the September survey. Once again, a follow-up question was posed to farmers who reported this being a “bad time” to make large investments to learn why they felt that way. For the third month in a row, producers overwhelmingly said it was primarily because of the increase in prices for farm machinery and new construction. However, interest rates are starting to become a factor influencing producers’ decision making. Throughout the summer the percentage of farmers who chose “rising interest rates” as a primary reason for thinking it’s a bad time to make large investments rose from 14% in August to 21% in September.</p>



<p>Fewer producers this month said they expect either no change in crop input prices or expect input prices to decline in 2023 compared to 2022 than in recent surveys, while more producers expect an input price rise that matches up more closely with the rate of inflation. In April, 18% of respondents expected input prices in 2023 to decline, whereas this month just one out of ten producers said they look for prices to fall up to 10% below 2022’s level. Over the same time frame, the percentage expecting no change in prices for 2023 declined from 28% to 19%. The largest share (38%) of producers this month expect input prices to rise from 1 up to 9%, compared to 18% who felt that way in April. And nearly a fourth of producers this month said they expect input prices to rise from 10 up to 19%, compared to just 15% of producers who expected input prices to rise that much back in April. Interestingly, in April one out of five producers looked for 2023 input prices to rise by 20% or more whereas in September, just 9% of survey respondents said they expect an input price rise of that magnitude.</p>



<p>Producers’ perspective on farmland values continues to soften. This month the&nbsp;<em>Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index</em>&nbsp;fell 5 points to 123 while the long-term index fell 7 points to 139. A year ago, the short-term index, which provides producers’ perspective one year into the future, stood at 155. This month’s reading leaves the index 21% lower than a year earlier while the long-term index has fallen 12% over the same time frame. In a follow-up question posed to respondents who expect farmland values to rise over the next 5 years, over 60% of respondents said that the main reason they expect values to rise is non-farm investor demand, up from 45 to 51% who thought that was the main driver back in January and February. At the same time, fewer respondents on this month’s survey said they expect low interest rates to support farmland values than in the past. In January and February, 6 to 9% of respondents who said they expect values to rise cited “low interest rates” as the main reason. In the September survey, just 1% of respondents pointed to low interest rates as the principal reason they expect farmland values to rise.</p>



<p>This month’s survey included a series of questions about cover crop usage as a follow-up to the same questions posed in 2021. Nearly six out of 10 (57%) of respondents said they currently plant cover crops on a portion of their farmland while approximately one out of four producers said they have never planted a cover crop. Most producers who report planting cover crops say they only do so on a portion of their farmland. Half of the farmers in this month’s survey who plant cover crops said they do so on 25% or less of their cropland. Nearly a fourth of respondents said they plant cover crops on over 50% of their farms’ acreage. A large share (40%) of producers who reported planting cover crops this month said they have been planting cover crops for 5 years or less. On the other end of the spectrum, 28% of respondents said they have been planting cover crops for more than 10 years. Reasons cited by producers for planting cover crops are varied, but “improve soil health” at 37% of respondents and “improve erosion control” at 33% of respondents were the top two reasons cited by cover crop users. Just 5% of cover crop users indicated “carbon sequestration” was a motivation for planting cover crops.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>



<p>Farmer sentiment drifted lower in September as the&nbsp;<em>Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;declined 5 points to 112. Weaker sentiment regarding current conditions was the primary driver of this month’s decline in the barometer. Input cost rises are a key factor behind the relative weakness in farmer sentiment. Producers are also becoming increasingly worried about the impact of rising interest rates on their farm operations with more of them citing it as a reason why they think now is not a good time to make large investments. Farmers’ perspective on farmland values showed further signs of softening this month as both the short and long-term farmland value indices declined. Farmers’ usage of cover crops appears to be increasing with 57% of respondents reporting that they use cover crops on at least some of their farmland. Most cover crop users employ cover crops on just a portion of their acreage, with improving soil health and improving erosion control cited as the two most common motivations for planting cover crops, while very few cover crop users said they plant cover crops primarily to sequester carbon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farmer sentiment improved in August as the&nbsp;<em>Purdue-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;index rose 14 points above its July reading to 117. The rise in the overall measure of agricultural producer sentiment was driven by increases in both the&nbsp;<em>Index of Current Conditions</em>, which rose 9 points in August to 118 and the&nbsp;<em>Index of Future Expectations</em>, which climbed 16 points in August to 116. Producers this month were less worried about their farm’s financial situation than in July, although they remain concerned about a possible cost/price squeeze. When asked about their biggest concerns for the next year, over half (53%) of respondents chose higher input costs. Other concerns included rising interest rates, input availability, and lower output prices chosen by 14, 12 and 11 percent of respondents, respectively. Despite this month’s improvement in sentiment, all three indices remain well below year ago levels. The&nbsp;<em>Purdue University-CME Group&nbsp;Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;sentiment index is calculated each month from 400 U.S. agricultural producers’ responses to a telephone survey. This month’s survey was conducted from August 15-19, 2022, which was after USDA released both the August&nbsp;<em>Crop Production</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>World Agricultural Supply &amp; Demand Estimates</em>&nbsp;reports.</p>

<div id="attachment_12626" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12626" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12626 size-full" src="https://ag.purdue.edu/commercialag/ageconomybarometer/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/figure2.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="696" srcset="https://ag.purdue.edu/commercialag/ageconomybarometer/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/figure2.jpg 960w, https://ag.purdue.edu/commercialag/ageconomybarometer/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/figure2-300x218.jpg 300w, https://ag.purdue.edu/commercialag/ageconomybarometer/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/figure2-768x557.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p id="caption-attachment-12626" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 2</strong>. Indices of Current Conditions and Future Expectations, October 2015-August 2022.</p></div>



<p>The&nbsp;<em>Farm Financial Performance Index</em>&nbsp;rose in August to 99, 11 points higher than a month earlier and 18 points higher than in May when the index was at its low point. Among respondents, there was a noticeable shift this month from producers expecting worse to better financial performance for their farms in 2022. Both corn and soybean prices rallied from their July lows into mid-August which, along with expectations for good yields, helped explain some of the improvement in financial performance expectations. Comparing the August survey’s end date to that of the July survey, prices for fall delivery of soybeans rose by about $1.50 per bushel while prices for fall delivery of corn rose by about $0.25 per bushel. Unlike last month, the improvement in expected financial performance this year carried over into expectations for next year as well. The percentage of producers expecting their farm to be better off financially a year from now rose while those expecting their farm to be worse off declined. Respondents were also a bit more optimistic about the U.S. agricultural economy as a whole in the upcoming year as the percentage expecting&nbsp;<em>bad times</em>&nbsp;for U.S. agriculture declined while those expecting&nbsp;<em>good times</em>&nbsp;rose.</p>



<p>There continues to be a tremendous amount of uncertainty among producers regarding the future cost of items they purchase both for their farms and family usage. Approximately four out of ten producers expect crop input prices in 2023 to be either unchanged or possibly decline by as much as 10%, compared to 2022, while just over half of all producers expect input prices to rise from 1 to 20%. Uncertainty among farmers about rising prices extends beyond crop input prices to consumer items as well. Nearly half (48%) of respondents this month said they expect the rate of inflation for consumer items during the next 12 months to be in the 0 to 6% range. Examining responses to this question over the last five months reveals a shift away from expecting a low rate of inflation (0 to 3%) to expecting a higher rate of inflation (3 to 6%). On the other end of the spectrum, the percentage of producers expecting very high inflation of over 10% declined from about one-third of respondents in the April through June surveys to 18% in the August survey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was a small improvement in the&nbsp;<em>Farm Capital Investment Index</em>&nbsp;in August as the index rose 3 points to a reading of 39. However, August was the sixth month in a row that the index remained below 40 indicating producers still view this as a relatively poor time to make large farm machinery and building investments. In a follow-up question posed in both the July and August surveys, respondents indicated the number one reason for thinking now is a bad time for these major capital expenditures is the increase in prices that’s taken place. This month nearly half (49%) of farmers in our survey chose an&nbsp;<em>increase in prices</em>&nbsp;as their primary reason for viewing now as a bad time for making large investments. Despite the negative sentiment expressed about this being a bad time for large investments, the percentage of producers who say they plan to reduce their farm machinery purchases has been declining since spring. In March, 62% of respondents said their farm machinery purchases in the upcoming year would be lower than a year earlier. This month that percentage fell to 49%, the first time it’s been less than 50% since last December. Plans for farm building purchases also improved somewhat as well with responses shifting from the&nbsp;<em>reduce</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>about the same</em>&nbsp;categories.</p>

<p>Four out of ten corn and soybean producers expect farmland cash rental rates to rise in 2023 compared to 2022, which was virtually unchanged from responses received in the July survey. Among respondents who expect rental rates to rise, however, there was a modest shift in how large they expect the rate increase to be. This month 27% of respondents said they expect rates to rise up to 5% compared to 23% who were expecting a rise of that magnitude in July. At the same time, the percentage of respondents expecting rates to rise from 5 up to 10% declined 4 points to 39%.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400">The <em>Short-Term Farmland Value Index</em> was nearly the same in August as in July, rising just one point to a reading of 128.

Interestingly, among survey respondents who say they expect farmland values to rise over the next five years, there’s evidence of a trend developing with an increasing percentage of producers choosing <em>non-farm investor demand</em> as the main reason they expect values to rise. This month nearly six out of ten (57%) respondents who expect values to rise chose non-farm investor demand as the main reason.</p>

<p>Several&nbsp;<em>Ag Economy Barometer</em>&nbsp;survey’s over the last two years have included questions regarding producers’ exposure to and experience with companies offering payments for capturing carbon. In this month’s survey, 9 percent of respondents said they have engaged in discussions with companies offering payments for carbon capture. This is by far and away the highest percentage of respondents indicating they’ve engaged in carbon capture discussions with one or more companies. In prior surveys, the percentage of producers talking to companies about receiving payments for carbon capture ranged from a low of just over 2% to less than 6%. Three-fourths of respondents said the payment rate per metric ton of carbon offered was less than $20. Just 1% of all respondents to the August barometer survey said they have signed a carbon contract. The survey asked respondents who said they engaged in discussions but chose not to sign a carbon contract the minimum payment per acre they would accept to enroll their farm in a carbon capture program. Two-thirds of respondents said the payment rate needed to be at least $30 per acre, suggesting that payment rates need to rise to encourage more participation in carbon capture programs.</p>

<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>



<p>Farmer sentiment improved in August as the Ag Economy Barometer rose 14 points to a reading of 117. Producers expressed more confidence regarding both current conditions on their farms and especially their expectations for the future. U.S. farmers are still uneasy about what input costs will be for crops planted in 2023 as well as the impact of inflation on their family’s expenditures in the year ahead. Despite these concerns, producers remain relatively optimistic about farmland values both in the short and long term as they continue to expect non-farm investor interest to support farmland values.
