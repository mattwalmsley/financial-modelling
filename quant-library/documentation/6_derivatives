## Introduction

- Derivatives are financial products or assets whose structure and value is derived from another asset.
- The base asset is called the **underlying asset** (generally referred to as the underlying).
- The derivative is linked to the underlying through revenues paid to the holder of the derivative product - these revenues are known as **payoffs**.
  - The payoffs of a derivative are generally determined by the price of the underlying asset at a set point during the derivative contract's life - often the expiration date of the contract.
  - Arbitrage is the main tool for linking the derivative's value to its underlying.
- The price of the underlying asset is referred to as the **cash price** or **spot price** to distinguish it from the price of its derivatives.
- The underlying asset is traded on the **cash market**, assuming it is a cash product (not always the case).
- The profit and loss is the change in the value of an investment or financial position(s) and is usually shortened to **P&L**.

### Derivative Products

- **Forwards**/**futures**: contracts that lock in a price that two parties will exchange an asset for at a set future date.
- **Options**: contracts that give one party the right, but not the obligation, to exchange an asset.
- **Swaps**: contracts that allow two parties to exchange cash flows or liabilities from two different financial instruments. Interest rate swaps are the most common, facilitating a swap between a floating interest rate and a fixed one.
