## Introduction

- Derivatives are financial products or assets whose structure and value is derived from another asset.
- The base asset is called the **underlying asset** (generally referred to as the underlying).
- The derivative is linked to the underlying through revenues paid to the holder of the derivative product - these revenues are known as **payoffs**.
  - The payoffs of a derivative are generally determined by the price of the underlying asset at a set point during the derivative contract's life - often the expiration date of the contract.
  - Arbitrage is the main tool for linking the derivative's value to its underlying.
- The price of the underlying asset is referred to as the **cash price** or **spot price** to distinguish it from the price of its derivatives.
- The underlying asset is traded on the **cash market**, assuming it is a cash product (not always the case).
- The profit and loss is the change in the value of an investment or financial position(s) and is usually shortened to **P&L**.

### Derivative Products

- **Forwards**/**futures**: contracts that lock in a price that two parties will exchange an asset for at a set future date.
- **Options**: contracts that give one party the right, but not the obligation, to exchange an asset.
- **Swaps**: contracts that allow two parties to exchange cash flows or liabilities from two different financial instruments. Interest rate swaps are the most common, facilitating a swap between a floating interest rate and a fixed one.

### Derivative Markets

- Markets can be divided into **over the counter (OTC)** or on organised **exchanges**.
- OTC markets consist of deals between two counterparties that make private deals within financial regulations (little price transparency).
- Exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), allow for more standardised products and regulated trading which are visible to all market participants (price transparency).
- Generally, exchange-traded products are much more liquid than OTC products and have a less exposure to **counterparty credit risk** (risk of one counterparty failing to meet their obligations).
  - The exchange acts as a counterparty to every deal made with its clients and are subject to strict regulations.
  - With OTC deals, there is always a major concern than one counterparty will default.
- OTC markets allow for more customisable deals to be made between broker-dealers and clients, or between broker-dealers themselves.
- Following the 2008 financial crisis, there has been a push to move OTC products onto exchanges.

### Assumptions

- Transactions costs are zero.
- Unlimited investing and borrowing at the risk-free rate.
- No restrictions on short selling assets.

## Forwards

- A forward contract is an agreement between a buyer and seller where the seller agrees to sell an asset to the buyer at a set point in the future at a price agreed upon entering into the contract.
- By definition, forward contracts are traded on OTC markets and are often highly customised.
- Generally, one of the counterparties is a financial institution or dealer, whilst the other counterparty is an end user of another dealer.
- Forwards are usually used to hedge against changes in price.
- Terminology:
  - **Long position**: position of the buyer
  - **Short position**: position of the seller
  - **Expiration date or expiry**: agreed date on which the transaction will take place
  - **Forward price**: the agreed transaction price
- The **underlying asset** will be the asset that is traded at the forward contract's expiration date.
- The forward contract is priced such that the value is 0 at the time of entering into the contract.

### Settlement

- At the expiration date, forward contracts can be **settled by delivery** or by **cash settlement**.
- Settlement by delivery involves the seller exchange the underlying asset for the contract price with the buyer.
- In a cash settled deals, the party with the negative cash position at the expiry compensates the other party with cash.
- Due to the customised nature of the deals, forward contracts are illiquid securities and are usually held until expiry.

### Payoffs

- The revenue a particular counterparty earns from a derivative contract is referred to as the **payoff**.
- With forward contracts, neither the long position nor the short position receive any payment from the contract until the expiry date.
  - Therefore at expiration, the values of the long and short positions in a forward contract are equal to the long and short payoffs respectively.
- The payoff for a long position in a forward contract can be modelled as follows:
  - Using the following notation:
    - $S(t)$ as the price of the underlying asset at time $t$.
    - $K_{\tau}$ as the forward price for expiry $\tau$.
    - $T$ as the expiration (expiry date).
    - $V(t)$ as the value of the long position at time $t$.
  - At expiration of the contract, the underlying is transferred to the long position from the short position - the long position receives an asset (cash flow) with value $S(T)$.
  - The long position must pay the short position the forward price $K_{\tau}$ to receive the asset - this should be deducted from the value received in order to calculate the long position's payoff.
$$V(T) = S(T) - K_{\tau}$$
- Similarly, the short position's payoff is:
$$-V(T) = K_{\tau} - S(T)$$
- Graphically, this can be represented as follows:
