## Introduction

- Commodities are primary feedstocks that have regular pricing assessment, and are usually actively traded in both the physical and derivatives markets.
- Materials can be classed as *very-specialised* feedstocks or a combination of feedstocks that have been transformed into a material.
- The 3 major types of commodity are **agriculture**, **metals** and **energy**, although other types do exist - *carbon emissions*, *weather*, and *freight*.

### Agriculture

- Crops and livestock products that are used to sustain or support life.
- **Grains** are a primary source of carbohydrate in human/livestock diets.
  - Examples include corn, wheat, barley, and rice.
- **Oilseeds** are used for food and fuel.
  - The remaining materials, once the oil has been extracted, is known as the **meal** and is used for animal feed.
  - Examples include palm, soybean, sunflower and rapeseed/canola.
  - Cotton is also classed as an oilseed but is used predominantly for its natural fibres.
- **Softs** are grown in the tropical regions.
  - Examples include coffee, sugar, cocoa, orange juice, and rubber.
- **Livestock** products which are most commonly traded are cattle and hogs.
- **Dairy** products which are most commonly traded are milk and butter, as well as some cheese.

### Metals

- **Precious metals** include gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
- **Base (industrial) metals** include copper, zinc, aluminium etc.

### Energy

- **Crude oil** is the most liquid and active commodity market worldwide.
- Other traded products include **natural gas**, **coal**, and **power**.

## Market Participants

Participants in commodities markets and their derivatives will each have their own risk profiles and objectives.

### Physical Market Participants

Entities involved along the commodity supply chain, including producers, refiners, processors, and consumers.

- **Price Risk Exposure**
  - *Producers:* Exposed to falling prices of commodities.
  - *Consumers:* Exposed to rising prices of commodities.
  - *Refiners/Processors:* Exposed to margin risks (difference between income from selling final product and cost of raw materials).
- **Other Risks**
  - *Credit Risk:* Possibility of customers unwilling or unable to pay debts.
  - *Logistical Risks:* Challenges in the movement and transportation of commodities.
  - *Quality Sourcing:* Ensuring access to commodities of the right quality.
  - *Financing Operations:* Securing necessary funds for daily operational activities.

### Price Reporting Agencies (PRAs)

Organizations that assess and report commodity prices based on market data and informed analysis.

- **Role in the Market**
  - Collect and analyze transaction data and market information to assess spot prices.
  - Provide price transparency and assist in fair price discovery.
  - Publish price indexes used to settle commercial supply contracts and some futures transactions.
- Examples include agencies like *Platts*, which use qualitative and quantitative inputs for price assessments.

### Investment Banks

Financial institutions offering various services related to commodity markets.

- *Full-Service Banks:* Engage in both physical commodity trading and derivatives.
- *Derivative Services:* Provide financial instruments to hedge against commodity price risks.
- **Solutions Provided**
  - Financing inventory to ease working capital constraints.
  - Investing in infrastructure (e.g., pipelines, storage facilities) to solve delivery and logistical issues.
  - Acting as intermediaries between producers and consumers, facilitating smoother transactions.

### Commodity Trading Houses

Companies that buy, sell, and often control significant portions of commodity supply chains.

- Handle substantial volumes across various commodities like oil, grains, and metals.
- Control significant market shares in specific commodities (e.g., 60% of the zinc market).
- The growth in size of commodity trading houses over the past few decades is attributed to four main factors:
  1. Economic booms in emerging markets post-2000 increasing demand.
  2. Strategic acquisition of physical assets enhancing control over supply chains.
  3. Exploiting price arbitrage opportunities due to integrated supply chain presence.
  4. Industry consolidation leading to reduced competition and increased market dominance.

### Hedge Funds

Investment vehicles that pool funds from investors and employ various strategies to generate returns.

- Access typically limited to qualified investors.
- Actively managed with goals to achieve returns regardless of market conditions.
- Often utilize aggressive, view-driven strategies in commodity markets.

### Real Money Accounts

Institutional investors that invest without leveraging borrowed funds.

- **Examples Include**:
  - Pension funds, insurance companies, and other long-term investment entities.
  - Banks offering commodity investment products to retail customers.
- **Role in Commodity Markets**
  - Engage primarily for diversification and long-term investment returns.
  - Typically adopt more conservative investment strategies compared to hedge funds.

## Derivative Products

In commodities trading, forward contracts, futures , swaps, and options are used to speculate and secure prices for delivery at a future point in time, offering price certainty and risk management. These products are further explained in later sections: [Forwards, Futures, and Swaps](./7_forwards_futures_swaps.md) as well as [Options](./9_options.md)

### Forward Contracts

- Forward contracts are agreements to buy or sell a commodity at a future date for a price agreed upon today.
- These contracts are negotiated directly between the buyer and seller, often over-the-counter (OTC), and involve a binding commitment that cannot be easily exited without mutual agreement.
- A variation called a "floating forward" sets the price at the point of delivery, often based on a pre-agreed formula, such as the average of daily spot prices before settlement.

### Futures

- Futures are standardized contracts traded on organized exchanges like the CME Group, providing similar economic outcomes as forwards but with key differences in trading and margin requirements.
- Unlike forwards, futures contracts require an initial margin deposit (about 5% of the contract's market value) and are subject to ongoing margin adjustments based on market movements.
- Futures also ensure standardization in the quality and grade of the underlying commodity, such as specific requirements for the delivery of metals like gold.
- Most futures contracts (approximately 95%) are closed before their expiry, as they are typically used for risk management rather than physical delivery.

### Swaps

- Swaps are financial agreements where two parties exchange cash flows based on different price indices, typically involving one party paying a fixed rate and the other a variable or floating rate.
- These contracts are usually negotiated over-the-counter (OTC) and are based on a notional amount that sets the magnitude of the cash flows, though the notional amount itself is not exchanged.
- The main motivation for entering into a swap is risk management. For example, a company that regularly purchases a commodity at market prices might enter into a swap to hedge against potential price increases.
  - In this arrangement, the company would pay a fixed rate and receive cash flows based on market price movements, transferring the price risk to the counterparty, often an investment bank.
  - The bank, in turn, may offset this exposure by entering into a similar, opposite swap transaction and make a profit from the bid-offer spread.

#### Application of Swaps in Commodity Markets

- Swaps are used across various commodity markets to manage price risk:
  - Gold: Involves paying a fixed lease rate and receiving a variable lease rate.
  - Base Metals: A common swap might involve paying a fixed aluminum price and receiving the average price of near-dated aluminum futures, known as an "Asian swap" when the floating rate is based on an average price over a period.

#### Structure of Swap Products

- Swaps can start two days after trading (spot starting) or at a future date (forward starting).
- The frequency of cash flow settlements can vary between 1 and 12 months, depending on the terms negotiated between the parties.
- A unique feature of commodity swaps, particularly relevant in "Asian swaps," is the use of an average rate for the floating leg, which aligns with the average price exposures that many commodity hedgers face.
- Swaps are traded on a bid-offer spread basis.
- The market convention is that the buyer receives a stream of variable cash flows in exchange for a fixed rate, while the seller delivers floating cash flows and receives a fixed rate.
- Although terms like "buy" and "sell" are used, it's clearer to specify who pays and who receives the fixed rate to avoid confusion.

### Options

- Options provide a flexible alternative to forward contracts in commodities trading.
- While forward contracts lock the buyer into a fixed price, which can be unprofitable if the market price drops, options offer the buyer protection with the ability to benefit if the market moves in their favour.

> An option is a financial derivative that grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a commodity at a predetermined price (the strike price) on or before a specific date.

- Options come in two primary forms:
  - **Call Option**: Grants the right to buy the underlying commodity at the strike price.
  - **Put Option**: Grants the right to sell the underlying commodity at the strike price.
- The exercise price, or strike price, is negotiated between the buyer and seller.
- Options can be either physically settled, where the commodity is actually delivered, or cash-settled, where the difference between the strike price and the market price at expiration is paid in cash.
- Options can be exercised in different ways depending on their style:
  - **European**: Exercised only on the maturity date.
  - **American**: Exercised at any time before maturity.
  - **Bermudan**: Exercised on specific dates prior to maturity.
- The value of an option depends on its relationship to the market price:
  - **In-the-Money (ITM)**: The strike price is more favourable than the current market price.
  - **Out-of-the-Money (OTM)**: The strike price is less favourable than the current market price.
  - **At-the-Money (ATM)**: The strike price is equal to the current market price.
u- Options are purchased for a premium, which reflects their value and potential to protect against unfavourable market movements or to capitalize on favourable ones.
- Options can be employed in various strategies depending on the user's goals:
  - **Directional Exposure**: For speculating on market movements. For example, buying a call option to profit from an expected rise in gold prices.
  - **Implied Volatility Trading**: Focusing on the option’s behaviour before maturity, trading on the volatility itself.
  - **Hedging**: Offering a flexible risk management tool, often preferred over forwards for their ability to limit downside risk while allowing for upside potential.
  - **Outperformance**: Options can be used to achieve returns above certain benchmarks, like using options on gold to outperform standard interest rates.

## Valuation of Derivatives

- Commodities cannot be modelled as a future stream of cash flows, unlike bonds and stocks. Discounted cash flow analysis is therefore not used for pricing commodities.
- Market forces of supply and demand determine commodity prices; however, there are identifiable trends in commodity price time series, and other market driven features relating to seasonality.
- **Benchmarks** exist for certain assets to help with the valuation of non-homogenous products, e.g. crude oil is often priced relative to a futures contract on a Brent Blend.
  - A globally accepted benchmark will facilitate trading for different grades of a commodity.
  - E.g. a popular iron ore benchmark has a grade of 62% (i.e. the ore contains 62% iron, Fe). The traded grades of iron ore will vary from 30% to the mid 60% and be priced relative to the 62% benchmark price.

## Volatility

- Commodity prices are highly volatile based on the news and weather, but are also driven by highly speculative trading.

## Risks

- Many of the risks in other asset classes are also present in commodities - e.g. price and credit risk.
- Commodities are also exposed to a number of unique risks due to the physical nature of the asset.
- Market participants may try to avoid, retain transfer, reduce or increase these risks depending on the nature of their business and risk appetite.
- **Transportation** of the physical goods provide a risk due to the the potential for the product to be damaged or spoilt during transport, as well as the cost of the transport itself.
- The **storage** of the products also provides similar types of risk to transportation.

## Inventory and Storage Costs

- The theory of inventory has been a major advance in understanding commodity assets.
- The higher the inventory levels of a commodity, the lower the price volatility.
- Holding inventories allows both suppliers and consumers to operate with stability during a demand or supply shock.
  - Suppliers and consumers can react quickly to demand if they hold inventories.
- Generally, inventories stabilize commodities' prices, but will incur storage costs.

### Convenience Yield

- Inventories can be modelled in a similar way to dividend yields on stock, using *convenience yield*.
- Convenience yields are implemented as a continuously compounded return accruing to holdings of a commodity.
- The *net yield* accounts for the storage costs associated with holding an inventory and is modelled as a negative yield
$$Net \space Yield = Convenience \space Yield - Storage \space Costs$$
- Modelling the convenience yield $y$ and storage costs $s$ as continuously compounded, an investment of $\alpha$ units of a commodity with cost $C(t)$ would be $\alpha e^{(y - s)t}C(t)$, where $(y - s)$ represents the net yield.
- The convenience yield would never be modelled to be reinvested into the holdings of the assets.
