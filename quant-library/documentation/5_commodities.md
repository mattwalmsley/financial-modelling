## Introduction

- Commodities are primary feedstocks that have regular pricing assessment, and are usually actively traded in both the physical and derivatives markets.
- Materials can be classed as *very-specialised* feedstocks or a combination of feedstocks that have been transformed into a material.
- The 3 major types of commodity are **agriculture**, **metals** and **energy**, although other types do exist - *carbon emissions*, *weather*, and *freight*.

### Agriculture

- Crops and livestock products that are used to sustain or support life.
- **Grains** are a primary source of carbohydrate in human/livestock diets.
  - Examples include corn, wheat, barley, and rice.
- **Oilseeds** are used for food and fuel.
  - The remaining materials, once the oil has been extracted, is known as the **meal** and is used for animal feed.
  - Examples include palm, soybean, sunflower and rapeseed/canola.
  - Cotton is also classed as an oilseed but is used predominantly for its natural fibres.
- **Softs** are grown in the tropical regions.
  - Examples include coffee, sugar, cocoa, orange juice, and rubber.
- **Livestock** products which are most commonly traded are cattle and hogs.
- **Dairy** products which are most commonly traded are milk and butter, as well as some cheese.

### Metals

- **Precious metals** include gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
- **Base (industrial) metals** include copper, zinc, aluminium etc.

### Energy

- **Crude oil** is the most liquid and active commodity market worldwide.
- Other traded products include **natural gas**, **coal**, and **power**.

## Market Participants

Participants in commodities markets and their derivatives will each have their own risk profiles and objectives.

### Physical Market Participants

Entities involved along the commodity supply chain, including producers, refiners, processors, and consumers.

- **Price Risk Exposure**
  - *Producers:* Exposed to falling prices of commodities.
  - *Consumers:* Exposed to rising prices of commodities.
  - *Refiners/Processors:* Exposed to margin risks (difference between income from selling final product and cost of raw materials).
- **Other Risks**
  - *Credit Risk:* Possibility of customers unwilling or unable to pay debts.
  - *Logistical Risks:* Challenges in the movement and transportation of commodities.
  - *Quality Sourcing:* Ensuring access to commodities of the right quality.
  - *Financing Operations:* Securing necessary funds for daily operational activities.

### Price Reporting Agencies (PRAs)

Organizations that assess and report commodity prices based on market data and informed analysis.

- **Role in the Market**
  - Collect and analyze transaction data and market information to assess spot prices.
  - Provide price transparency and assist in fair price discovery.
  - Publish price indexes used to settle commercial supply contracts and some futures transactions.
- Examples include agencies like *Platts*, which use qualitative and quantitative inputs for price assessments.

### Investment Banks

Financial institutions offering various services related to commodity markets.

- *Full-Service Banks:* Engage in both physical commodity trading and derivatives.
- *Derivative Services:* Provide financial instruments to hedge against commodity price risks.
- **Solutions Provided**
  - Financing inventory to ease working capital constraints.
  - Investing in infrastructure (e.g., pipelines, storage facilities) to solve delivery and logistical issues.
  - Acting as intermediaries between producers and consumers, facilitating smoother transactions.

### Commodity Trading Houses

Companies that buy, sell, and often control significant portions of commodity supply chains.

- Handle substantial volumes across various commodities like oil, grains, and metals.
- Control significant market shares in specific commodities (e.g., 60% of the zinc market).
- The growth in size of commodity trading houses over the past few decades is attributed to four main factors:
  1. Economic booms in emerging markets post-2000 increasing demand.
  2. Strategic acquisition of physical assets enhancing control over supply chains.
  3. Exploiting price arbitrage opportunities due to integrated supply chain presence.
  4. Industry consolidation leading to reduced competition and increased market dominance.

### Hedge Funds

Investment vehicles that pool funds from investors and employ various strategies to generate returns.

- Access typically limited to qualified investors.
- Actively managed with goals to achieve returns regardless of market conditions.
- Often utilize aggressive, view-driven strategies in commodity markets.

### Real Money Accounts

Institutional investors that invest without leveraging borrowed funds.

- **Examples Include**:
  - Pension funds, insurance companies, and other long-term investment entities.
  - Banks offering commodity investment products to retail customers.
- **Role in Commodity Markets**
  - Engage primarily for diversification and long-term investment returns.
  - Typically adopt more conservative investment strategies compared to hedge funds.

## Volatility

- Commodity prices are highly volatile based on the news and weather, but are also driven by highly speculative trading.

## Risks

- Many of the risks in other asset classes are also present in commodities - e.g. price and credit risk.
- Commodities are also exposed to a number of unique risks due to the physical nature of the asset.
- Market participants may try to avoid, retain transfer, reduce or increase these risks depending on the nature of their business and risk appetite.
- **Transportation** of the physical goods provide a risk due to the the potential for the product to be damaged or spoilt during transport, as well as the cost of the transport itself.
- The **storage** of the products also provides similar types of risk to transportation.

## Inventory and Storage Costs

- The theory of inventory has been a major advance in understanding commodity assets.
- The higher the inventory levels of a commodity, the lower the price volatility.
- Holding inventories allows both suppliers and consumers to operate with stability during a demand or supply shock.
  - Suppliers and consumers can react quickly to demand if they hold inventories.
- Generally, inventories stabilize commodities' prices, but will incur storage costs.

### Convenience Yield

- Inventories can be modelled in a similar way to dividend yields on stock, using *convenience yield*.
- Convenience yields are implemented as a continuously compounded return accruing to holdings of a commodity.
- The *net yield* accounts for the storage costs associated with holding an inventory and is modelled as a negative yield
$$Net \space Yield = Convenience \space Yield - Storage \space Costs$$
- Modelling the convenience yield $y$ and storage costs $s$ as continuously compounded, an investment of $\alpha$ units of a commodity with cost $C(t)$ would be $\alpha e^{(y - s)t}C(t)$, where $(y - s)$ represents the net yield.
- The convenience yield would never be modelled to be reinvested into the holdings of the assets.
