# Bonds

- Bonds can be regarded as a *debt instrument*, whereby the "owner" of the bond is also the "owner" of a debt.
  - Debt can therefore be traded on the bond and money markets.
- Bonds are created when a **bond issuer** first offers bonds for sale on a market. These bonds are then purchased by **bond holders** (also known as **bond buyers** ).
- The price of the bond represents the amount loaned to the bond issuer by the bond holder - i.e. the debt.
- The price of a bond (i.e. the principal of the loan) is called the **par value** or **face value**.
