## Introduction

- Derivatives are financial products or assets whose structure and value is derived from another asset.
- The base asset is called the **underlying asset** (generally referred to as the underlying).
- The derivative is linked to the underlying through revenues paid to the holder of the derivative product - these revenues are known as **payoffs**.
  - The payoffs of a derivative are generally determined by the price of the underlying asset at a set point during the derivative contract's life - often the expiration date of the contract.
  - Arbitrage is the main tool for linking the derivative's value to its underlying.
- The price of the underlying asset is referred to as the **cash price** or **spot price** to distinguish it from the price of its derivatives.
- The underlying asset is traded on the **cash market**, assuming it is a cash product (not always the case).
- The profit and loss is the change in the value of an investment or financial position(s) and is usually shortened to **P&L**.

### Derivative Products

- **Forwards**/**futures**: contracts that lock in a price that two parties will exchange an asset for at a set future date.
- **Options**: contracts that give one party the right, but not the obligation, to exchange an asset.
- **Swaps**: contracts that allow two parties to exchange cash flows or liabilities from two different financial instruments. Interest rate swaps are the most common, facilitating a swap between a floating interest rate and a fixed one.

### Derivative Markets

- Markets can be divided into **over the counter (OTC)** or on organised **exchanges**.
- OTC markets consist of deals between two counterparties that make private deals within financial regulations (little price transparency).
- Exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), allow for more standardised products and regulated trading which are visible to all market participants (price transparency).
- Generally, exchange-traded products are much more liquid than OTC products and have a less exposure to **counterparty credit risk** (risk of one counterparty failing to meet their obligations).
  - The exchange acts as a counterparty to every deal made with its clients and are subject to strict regulations.
  - With OTC deals, there is always a major concern than one counterparty will default.
- OTC markets allow for more customisable deals to be made between broker-dealers and clients, or between broker-dealers themselves.
- Following the 2008 financial crisis, there has been a push to move OTC products onto exchanges.

### Assumptions

- Transactions costs are zero.
- Unlimited investing and borrowing at the risk-free rate.
- No restrictions on short selling assets.

## Forwards

- A forward contract is an agreement between a buyer and seller where the seller agrees to sell an asset to the buyer at a set point in the future at a price agreed upon entering into the contract.
- By definition, forward contracts are traded on OTC markets and are often highly customised.
- Generally, one of the counterparties is a financial institution or dealer, whilst the other counterparty is an end user of another dealer.
- Forwards are usually used to hedge against changes in price.
- Terminology:
  - **Long position**: position of the buyer
  - **Short position**: position of the seller
  - **Expiration date or expiry**: agreed date on which the transaction will take place
  - **Forward price**: the agreed transaction price
- The **underlying asset** will be the asset that is traded at the forward contract's expiration date.
- The forward contract is priced such that the value is 0 at the time of entering into the contract.

### Settlement

- At the expiration date, forward contracts can be **settled by delivery** or by **cash settlement**.
- Settlement by delivery involves the seller exchange the underlying asset for the contract price with the buyer.
- In a cash settled deals, the party with the negative cash position at the expiry compensates the other party with cash.
- Due to the customised nature of the deals, forward contracts are illiquid securities and are usually held until expiry.

### Payoffs

- The revenue a particular counterparty earns from a derivative contract is referred to as the **payoff**.
- With forward contracts, neither the long position nor the short position receive any payment from the contract until the expiry date.
  - Therefore at expiration, the values of the long and short positions in a forward contract are equal to the long and short payoffs respectively.
- The payoff for a long position in a forward contract can be modelled as follows:
  - Using the following notation:
    - $S(t)$ as the price of the underlying asset at time $t$.
    - $K_{\tau}$ as the forward price for expiry $\tau$.
    - $T$ as the expiration (expiry date).
    - $V(t)$ as the value of the long position at time $t$.
  - At expiration of the contract, the underlying is transferred to the long position from the short position - the long position receives an asset (cash flow) with value $S(T)$.
  - The long position must pay the short position the forward price $K_{\tau}$ to receive the asset - this should be deducted from the value received in order to calculate the long position's payoff.
$$V(T) = S(T) - K_{\tau}$$
- Similarly, the short position's payoff is:
$$-V(T) = K_{\tau} - S(T)$$
- Graphically, this can be represented as follows:

### Pricing

- The value of the **long position**, $V(T) = S(T) - K_{\tau}$, can be calculated by using the Law of One Price and constructing a portfolio which models the payoff at time $t = T$.
  - $S(T)$ can be modelled by holding the underlying asset in the portfolio.
  - $-K_{T}$ can be modelled as a cash payment (debt) discounted at time $t = 0$. This discounted (absolute) value is calculated by $e^{-rT}K_{T}$.
  - The future value of this debt at time $t$ can then be calculated by $e^{rt}\left(e^{-rT}K_{T}\right)$.
  - The value of this portfolio at time $t$ is modelled as follows:
$$V(t) = S(t) - e^{rt}\left(e^{-rT}K_{T}\right)$$
$$\boxed{V(t) = S(t) - e^{-r(T-t)}K_{T}}$$
- This model can be validated by showing that at time $t = T$, the value of the portfolio is equal to $S(T) - K_{T}$:
$$V(T) = S(T) - e^{-r(T-T)}K_{T}$$
$$V(T) = S(T) - e^{0}K_{T}$$
$$V(T) = S(T) - K_{T}$$
- Using the Law of One Price, the value of the forward contract $V(t)$ at any time $t < T$ must be equal to the value of the portfolio.
- Similarly, the payoff of the **short position** can be modelled as:
$$\boxed{-V(t) = e^{-r(T-t)}K_{T} - S(t)}$$
- The forward price $K_{T}$ is set such that the value of the forward contract at $t = 0$ will be zero: $V(0) = 0$ and can be calculated as follows:
$$V(0) = S(0) - e^{-r(T-0)}K_{T} = 0$$
$$\Longrightarrow S(0) - e^{-rT}K_{T} = 0$$
$$\therefore S(0) = e^{-rT}K_{T}$$
$$\boxed{K_{T} = e^{rT}S(0)}$$

#### Cash and Carry Arbitrage

- Forward prices may be deduced from two arbitrage strategies: the cash and carry arbitrage, and the reverse cash and carry arbitrage.
- Recall the forward price, $K_{T} = e^{rT}S(0)$, where $S(t)$ is the underlying spot price, $r$ is the risk-free rate and $T$ is the expiration date of the forward contract.
- If $K_{T} > e^{rT}S(0)$, a **cash and carry arbitrage** can be constructed and therefore this inequality will never be present. The portfolio can be constructed as follows:
  - Take a short position in the forward contract.
  - Borrow $S(0)$ in cash at the risk-free rate and purchase the underlying with the proceeds.
  - The portfolio has three components:
    1. the short forward position
    2. the underlying asset
    3. a debt of $S(0)e^{rt}$ at time $t$
  - This portfolio is held until time $T$, at which point the short forward position (1) is exited by transferring the underlying asset (2) to the long forward position (counterparty) for the  contract price $K_{T}$.
  - The debt of $S(0)e^{rT}$ (3) can be repaid, leaving a **profit** of $K_{T} - e^{rT}S(0)$.
- Similarly $K_{T} < e^{rT}S(0)$ will lead to a **reverse cash and carry arbitrage** by constructing the following portfolio:
  - Take a long position in the forward contract.
  - Take a short position in the underlying and invest the proceeds $S(0)$ at the risk-free rate.
  - The portfolio has three components:
    1. the long forward position
    2. the short position in the underlying asset
    3. a cash holding of $S(0)e^{rt}$ at time $t$
  - This portfolio is held until time $T$, at which point the forward contract price $K_{T}$ is paid to exit the long forward position (1). This then delivers the underlying asset which is used to exit the short position in the underlying asset (2).
  - The cash holding of $S(0)e^{rT}$ (3) is left, leaving a **profit** of $e^{rT}S(0) - K_{T}$.
- The **cost of carry** in the cash and carry portfolio was only the risk-free rate $r$; however, there will generally be other financing charges and costs associated with storage, transportation and holding. Additionally any income from holding the underlying asset such as dividends or convenience yields should be considered.
- For the reverse cash and carry arbitrage, the **cost of carry** is reversed due to the short position in the underlying asset so any charges are received as income.

### Zero Coupon Bond Example

- Take a forward contract on zero-coupon bond maturing in 1 year and a risk-free interest rate of 3.5%.
- If the bond currently has a market price of 925 USD, the forward price for a 6 month forward contract on this bond can be calculated as follows:
  - Assume the risk-free rate, $r = 0.035$, is continuously compounded.
  - The value of the underlying $S$ at $t = 0$ is $925 \space USD$
  - The forward contract expiration $T$ is $0.5$
  - Taking the formula for the forward price a $K = e^{rT}S(0)$, the price of a 6 month forward contract on this bond is calculated as $e^{0.035 \times 2} \times 925 \Longrightarrow 941.33 \space USD$
- If one bond dealer offers a forward price of 950 USD, a riskless profit can be obtained as follows:
  - Borrow 925 USD and buy the underlying bond.
  - Enter into a short position in the forward contract with forward price 950 USD.
  - This creates a portfolio with the following components:
    1. the short forward position
    2. the bond
    3. a debt valued at $e^{0.035t}(925)$ at time $t$.
  - This portfolio is held for 6 months, by which time the debt is worth 941.33 USD (this is also the fair forward price we calculated).
  - The short position in the forward contract can be exited by selling the bond for 950 USD.
  - This leaves a profit of $950 - 941.33 = 8.67 \space USD$
- If another bond dealer offers a forward price of 935 USD, a riskless profit can be obtained as follows:
  - Enter into a short position in the underlying bond and receive 925 USD in cash to invest at the risk-free rate.
  - Enter into a long position in the forward contract with forward price 935 USD.
  - This creates a portfolio with the following components:
    1. the long forward position
    2. the short position in the underlying bond
    3. a cash investment valued at $e^{0.035t}(925)$ at time $t$.
  - This portfolio is held for 6 months, by which time the cash investment is worth 941.33 USD.
  - This cash investment can be used to exit the forward contract and buy the bond for the price of 935 USD.
  - The short position in the underlying bond can fulfilled using the purchased bond.
  - This leaves a profit of $941.33 - 935 = 6.33 \space USD$
