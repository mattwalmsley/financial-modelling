# Options

## Introduction

- Options are contracts between two counterparties that gives one counterparty *the right but not the obligation* to buy/sell a particular asset to/from the other counterparty at a price agreed to upon entering the contract.
  - An option to **buy** is called a **call**.
  - An option to **sell** is called a **put**.
  - The counterparty with the option is the **buyer** or **holder** and they will **exercise** the option upon deciding to buy or sell at the agreed price.
  - The counterparty which must accept the decision of the buyer is the **seller** or **writer** of the option.
- Option contracts will have a predefined **specification** that states the **underlying** asset, the **quantity** of that asset, the **type** (call/put), the **strike** price, and the **expiration** date of the contract.
  - The **strike price** is the price at which the underlying asset will be bought or sold should the option be exercised.
- There are different convention for exercising options with the two most common being:
  - **European options** can only be exercised at the expiration date.
  - **American options** can be exercised at any time between the contract origination and expiry.
- Options are written on stocks, indexes, currencies, commodities, interest rate products and on the futures contracts of these products (most commodity option contracts are options on futures).
