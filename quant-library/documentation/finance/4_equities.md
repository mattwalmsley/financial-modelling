## Introduction

- **Common stock** denotes securities which imply an ownership position (equity) in a company. Usually this is just referred to as *stock*.
- The indivisible unit of a stock is a **share** (although *fractional shares* do exist) and the owners of a company's stock are called the *shareholders*.
- A **charter** or **certificate of incorporation** outlines the rights of the shareholders.
- Shareholders are paid **dividends** (depending on the company) out of the earnings.
- Shareholders also possess voting rights as specified by the company's charter.
- **Debt holders** receive interest payments before any dividends are paid by the company. They are the first to be compensated in the case of bankruptcy.#
- **Preferred stock holders** have next priority after the debt holders for receiving dividends and reimbursement in the case of liquidation of the company. However, they do not have voting rights and have limited potential for capital gain as their dividends are usually fixed.

### Stock Markets

- Shares in **privately held companies** are bought and sold in private deals with very little transparency to the public.
- **Publicly traded companies** are listed on prominent stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the NASDAQ, the London Stock Exchange, or on over the counter (OTC) markets.
  - **Over the counter (OTC) markets** consist of networks of dealers who make private transaction amongst themselves and with customers.

### Dividends

- The dividend policy will vary from company to company depending on the corporate strategy.
- Generally, more established companies will pay dividends whilst younger, growing companies will reinvest their earnings (R&D etc.) instead of paying dividends.
- Dividends are normally paid on a *per share* basis and therefore stock holders will receive a cash amount for each share they own.
- The **ex-dividend date** is the cut-off point for being eligible to receive dividends. Investors who purchase stock *on or after* the ex-dividend date are will not be paid dividends on their shares.
  - Due to market force, the share price drops by the value of the divided per share on the ex-dividend date.
- The **dividend yield** is the value of the dividends that a company pays out per year as a percentage of its share price.
  - If a stock, with price $S(t)$, pays dividends, the dividend yield can be modelled as a continuously compounded yield $y$, acting like an interest rate.
  - At time $t = 0$, with an initial allocation of $\alpha$ shares, and assuming all dividends are reinvested into the stock holding, the allocation at time $t$ is $\alpha e^{yt}$.
  - The investment at time $t$ is therefore $\alpha e^{yt}S(t)$.
  - Modelling the dividends with a continuous yield is most appropriate for stock indices or portfolios. For an individual stock, a more accurate model is to model the dividend as a lump sum payment.

### Valuation

- Supply and demand on the markets is the primary force behind the **share prices**. Valuation theory for stocks is based on the same core principle as bond valuation theory.
- The fair value of a stock is calculated as the present value of the stream of income the stock is expected to generate; however, unlike with bonds, the income stream is uncertain.
  - The discount factors in stock valuation must therefore incorporate the uncertainty of any future cash flows. Risk-free rates should not be used.
- The **dividend discount model** calculates the value as the present value of the stream of dividend payments. The **Modigliani-Miller Theorem** proposed that a company's dividend policy is immaterial to its value and the future earnings would be a better measure of a company's valuation.
- Most valuation models agree that the value of a company is predominantly determined by its future profitability.

### Volatility

- Relevant news being announced (by either the company themselves or by the media) can increase the volatility of company's share price.
- The volatility level of the majority of share prices is viewed as being too high to be solely based on expectations.
- Purely speculative activity, separate from economic fundamentals, is viewed as the main reason for the excess volatility on share prices.
